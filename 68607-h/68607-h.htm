<h2><a id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>

<p class="nind">THE name of Don Sebastian immediately recals to every historical reader,
a character, which youth, faults, virtues, and misfortunes, have
rendered highly interesting: I selected such a one for my Hero, from the
wish of shewing how “sweet are the uses of adversity.”</p>

<p>If I may be so fortunate as to instruct and to amuse at the same time,
the utmost of my literary ambition will be gratified.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_vi">{vi}</a></span></p>

<p>It has been my aim to keep as close to historical records, as was
consistent with a work wherein imagination is allowed to make up for the
deficiencies of actual tradition. In some places I have been obliged to
antedate an event, and to mix other motives of action with such as were
avowed by the persons then acting on the great theatre of Europe; but I
have scrupulously avoided slandering the illustrious dead, and am not
conscious of having materially altered any well-known portrait.</p>

<p>Some readers may be offended or wearied with the frequent use which I
have made of religious tenets; to them I can only offer one apology;&#8212;I
had no other way of reconciling the conduct of Catholic powers, with
what I have been<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_vii">{vii}</a></span> obliged to suppose, their conviction of Don
Sebastian’s identity when he re-appeared at Venice; and as his chief
calamity was the product of a bigotted attachment to the doctrines of
Rome, I could scarcely make that calamity effect the necessary
revolution in his general character, without changing also the nature of
his religious opinions.</p>

<p>In my delineation of countries, manners, &amp;c. I have endeavoured to give
as faithful a picture as was possible to one who describes after the
accounts of others; I consulted the voyages and tours of those days; so
that the modern traveller, in journeying with me over Barbary, Persia,
and Brazil, must recollect that he is beholding those countries as they
appeared in the sixteenth century.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_viii">{viii}</a></span></p>

<p>By accident, I met with an ancient work upon South America, in which was
the following sentence: “twelve leagues southward from St. Salvador,
appears the village of Cachoeira, formerly belonging to an unknown
Portuguese, who took great pains in reforming the savage people
Guaymures to a civil life.” This hint suggested to me the idea of making
the Portuguese, and my principal character, the same person.</p>

<p>I am told that there has been a novel written in French on the same
story, which forms the ground work of mine, but I have not seen it. The
materials with which I have worked, have been drawn from general
history, accounts of particular periods, the Harleian Miscellany, and a
curious old tract published in 1602,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_ix">{ix}</a></span> containing the letters of Texere,
De Castro, and others, with minute details of the conduct and sufferings
of the mysterious personage concerning whom it treats.</p>

<p>I trust the candid reader will excuse many defects in this romance, when
he considers how long was the space of time to be filled up with events
solely imaginary, and which it was indispensable so to occupy, as to
unite facts and to give the whole the semblance of probability: he will
reflect also how difficult it was for me to find any historical action
of sufficient weight and brilliancy, with which I might have earlier
concluded the adventures of Sebastian.</p>

<p>If my unpresuming work should disappoint the reader, he must suffer me
to<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_x">{x}</a></span> assure him that neither diligence in obtaining information, and
selecting circumstances, nor industry in using them, has been spared. I
may fail from want of ability, but not from want of application.</p>

<h2><a id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p class="nind">NEVER has the pen of history had to record a more affecting event, than
that which bore the house of Braganza to another hemisphere: animated by
a noble disdain of submitting to foreign despotism, and bravely placing
his country, not in the land of Portugal, but in the hearts of her
people, the Prince Regent conquered in adversity, and triumphed even at
the moment of despair.</p>

<p>Like the pious Eneas, who snatched from the flames of Troy, his father
and his household Gods, he hastened to save<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_xii">{xii}</a></span> some relics of Portugal; he
hastened to embark his family and their adherents on board the national
fleet; to launch with them on the hitherto untried deep, and to lead
them under the protection of Great Britain, to found a new empire in a
new world.</p>

<p>It was on the morning of the 29th of November, 1807, that these patriot
emigrants quitted the bay of Lisbon; they looked back on their forsaken
capital, with emotions too strong and too complicated for description:
every individual had left behind him some aged, or infirm, or timid
relative, whom it was agony to abandon, and whom he quitted with the
conviction of never seeing again; the scenes of their childhood, their
vineyards, and their cities, nay even the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_xiii">{xiii}</a></span> shores of their native land,
were never more to gladden their eyes!</p>

<p>A solemn pause had followed the noise and distraction of their
embarkation; Lisbon was motionless: profound stillness, like that
silence which surrounds the death bed of a mother, rested within her
walls: every heart felt its impression.</p>

<p>Advancing with majestic slowness down the Tagus, the Portuguese fleet
crossed the bar, and entered between the lines formed by the navy of
England: the cannons of the two fleets answered each other; the sounds,
doubled and redoubled by numerous echoes, were prolonged after the smoke
had cleared away, and discovered the ships of Portugal and of Britain
mingled together on the Atlantic ocean.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_xiv">{xiv}</a></span></p>

<p>Having exchanged gratulation and farewel with the Embassador and the
gallant Admiral of the friendly squadron, the Prince Regent gave a last,
long look to Portugal, and forcibly tore himself from the deck of his
vessel. In the cabin, he found part of the royal family yielding
themselves up to regret and anxiety: he suffered them to weep without
interruption, till the moment in which lamentation made a pause; he then
took the united hands of his daughter, and of his nephew, the Prince of
Spain, and pressing them within his own, held them with a look, serious,
sad, yet collected.</p>

<p>“Let us dry our tears,” he said; “let us bravely submit to our fate, and
bless God for having allowed us to retain that which ennobles every
situation&#8212;Free<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_xv">{xv}</a></span>dom!&#8212;We go, my children, to seek a new world; to found
there a new empire; it belongs to us to stamp the future character of an
unborn nation:&#8212;May we feel the gratitude of such responsibility!&#8212;As
our example shall persuade, as our authority shall impel, so will vice
or virtue prevail in Trans-atlantic Portugal; her existence, her
expansion, her dignity, her immortality, depend upon her princes and
nobles. Be this truth engraven on your hearts! may its awful voice
resound for ever in your ears, influencing your lives to the exercise of
all the social duties.”</p>

<p>Among the state treasures, I have preserved one most precious; ’tis the
history of an illustrious ancestor, more unfortunate than ourselves, but
for whom misfortune was a blessing.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_xvi">{xvi}</a></span></p>

<p>“We will read this MSS together; the style and the arrangement may
offend a nice judgment, because they are the production of an humble
pen; but the story itself is interesting, and the character of our
ancestor may serve as an important lesson to ourselves: compose your
spirits my dear children&#8212;listen to me with attention.”</p>

<p>While the Prince was speaking, he drew from his breast a large roll of
written paper, and after such of his family, as were present, had seated
themselves eagerly around him, he read in a voice somewhat agitated by
late emotion, the following narrative.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_1">{1}</a></span></p>

<hr />

<p class="c"><span class="big">DON SEBASTIAN,</span><br /><br />

<small>OR</small>
<br /><br /><span class="big">
THE HOUSE OF BRAGANZA.</span></p>

<h2><a id="CHAP_I"></a>CHAP. I.</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">On</span> the 12th of January, 1554, Juan, prince of Portugal, breathed his
last, in the palace of Ribera, at Lisbon.</p>

<p>At that sad moment grief and dismay seized the hearts of his royal
parents; as they alternately clasped his senseless clay in their arms,
and thought of all he had been, they almost forgot their hope of soon
possessing a memorial of his fair-promising youth.</p>

<p>Ignorant of her husband’s danger, his young consort had been removed to
the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_2">{2}</a></span> palace of Xabregas, in the suburbs; there, while he was struggling
between life and death, she was impatiently awaiting the hour which was
to bless her with the first pledge of their happiness and their love.
Under such circumstances the concealment of prince Juan’s death became
an act of necessity; at least as it regarded the princess, whose life,
and that of her unborn infant, would have been risked by a disclosure.</p>

<p>She was now tenderly deceived by all around her; the King and Queen
painfully dissembling their affliction visited her as usual, daily
bringing with them little billets from their son, whose anxious love had
early foreseen and provided against this trying occasion. He had left
behind him several letters without dates, expressive of the fondest
attachment, and pathetically lamenting the slow progress of his
recovery, which alone kept him from her society: he had ordered these to
be given her from time to time, until<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_3">{3}</a></span> she should have safely brought
into the world another heir to the crown of Portugal: after that period
deception was to cease.</p>

<p>Soothed by this sweet error the young princess yielded to the desire of
her royal parents, that she should not attempt returning to Ribera
before the birth of her child: she yielded with tears, but they were not
tears of apprehension; she wept only because her situation denied her
the tender office of watching her husband’s returning health. Again and
again she read his letters, again and again she dwelt on their blissful
meeting, when she should have an infant to present him with: happily
unconscious that the husband and the father, the young and beauteous
prince, was laid at rest for ever, in the grave!</p>

<p>Lisbon became now a scene of hope and sorrow. Lamentations for one
beloved prince was mixed with anxiety for the birth of another: solemn
fasts were ordained, vows offered, pilgrimages under<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_4">{4}</a></span>taken, processions
made. On the eighth day after Juan’s decease, at the dead of the night
preceding the feast of St. Sebastian, all the religious orders in
Portugal were seen headed by the archbishop, and cardinal Henry, walking
in awful silence, barefooted and dejected, bearing in their hands
mourning torches to light them on their way to the grand church of
Bethlehem: there mass for the soul of their departed prince was
celebrated, with all the pomp of that church which affects and
overwhelms the heart by its powerful appeal to the senses. Images,
relics, incense, music, all contributed to heighten pity and grief into
madness: groans and prayers were for awhile the only sounds heard
mingling with the wailing tones of the organ: at length even these
ceased, and the priests and the people remained in silence prostrate
before the host.</p>

<p>At that moment a shout from the multitude without, broke the solemn
pause; the next instant this cry was heard&#8212;“a<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_5">{5}</a></span> Prince! a Prince is
born!” The whole mass of suppliants started from the earth; the organ
burst into a loud swell; the priests and the people joined their voices;
and the dome of the cathedral rang with hymns and thanksgiving.</p>

<p>Thus in the midst of national hopes and fears was born the heir of
Portugal. His grand-uncle, the cardinal Don Henry, soon afterwards named
him Sebastian, in honor of the saint’s day upon which he was given to
their prayers; and then rejoicings and illuminations took place all over
the kingdom.</p>

<p>When the princess Joanna’s safety was thoroughly ascertained, the
mournful task of preparing her to hear the account of her husband’s
death was undertaken by the Queen: she gradually presented less cheering
letters from her son; till at length venturing to pronounce the fatal
truth, she called upon the princess to live for her child and them.
Joanna heard not these exhortations: she swooned re<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_6">{6}</a></span>peatedly; reviving
only to call, with frantic cries, upon him whose “ear was now stopped
with dust.”</p>

<p>From that hour no human effort availed to comfort her: scarcely sixteen,
this heaviest of all mortal sorrows was the first suffering her heart
had known: even her infant son, though she loved him to agony, failed to
reanimate her hopes: as she held him in her arms she would bathe him in
tears and think but the more of his father. A curtain of adamant had
fallen between her and the world: she felt it; and fearful of being
urged into new engagements hereafter, determined upon withdrawing to the
sanctuary of a religious profession.</p>

<p>While the widowed princess was inwardly revolving how best to compass
this melancholy desire, she was summoned into Spain by her brother
Philip II., then just setting out for Flanders to negociate his nuptials
with Mary of England. By accepting the regency during<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_7">{7}</a></span> his absence, she
hoped to find an opportunity for tranquillizing her mind previous to a
renunciation of all sublunary ties; and trusted, that when far from the
scene of past happiness and future anxiety&#8212;when removed from the
afflicting pleasure of her infant’s smiles, she might succeed in giving
up her whole soul to Christ and God. Aware of the opposition which would
be made to this resolution in Portugal, the princess confined it to her
own breast; but while she took an affecting leave of the King and Queen,
could not refrain from exclaiming&#8212;“O my parents! we shall never meet
again.” These words were at the time ascribed to the forebodings of a
heart which believed itself breaking, but were afterwards remembered as
proofs of a steadily pursued resolution.</p>

<p>From her child the youthful mother tore herself with difficulty: in the
midst of its innocent endearments, she felt that all delightful emotions
had not been buried with her husband. For the first time<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_8">{8}</a></span> her heart
whispered that she was not utterly desolate, since she had yet something
precious to relinquish.</p>

<p>Melted from her purpose, trembling, and bathed in tears, Joanna sunk
upon a seat: “Ah, my child!” she exclaimed, straining it to her
breast&#8212;“how can I leave thee to see thee no more?”</p>

<p>The King and Queen not venturing to speak, folded their arms around her:
their tremulous, yet strong pressure, spoke a joyful hope of detaining
her: at that instant she raised her eyes, overflowing with consent; but
they fell on the picture of Juan drawn in his bridal habit. At this
piercing sight, she shrieked, covered her face, wildly repeating&#8212;“O no,
no; I shall but love him and lose him too.”</p>

<p>Impressed with this sudden dread of living to witness the premature
death of her son, the princess broke from every attempt to detain her,
and hurried through the palace. Her retinue waited at the gates: she
threw herself into a carriage,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_9">{9}</a></span> and amidst guards and attendants left
Portugal never to return.</p>

<p>A destroying angel seemed at this period to be commissioned for the
affliction of that unhappy country. The death of prince Juan had been
followed by the voluntary departure of his interesting widow; and regret
for the last misfortune, was absorbed in grief for the loss of Louis,
Duke de Beja, brother to the King: the King himself, sinking under
sorrow and sickness, shortly afterwards terminated his exemplary life,
leaving a monarch of three years old, whose long minority threatened
many political calamities.</p>

<p>The Queen now unwillingly undertook the regency, a task imposed on her
by her late husband. For awhile she administered the laws, and guided
public measures, with a wise and impartial spirit: but at length wearied
with groundless animadversions, she grew timid of her own counsels, and
gladly transferred the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_10">{10}</a></span> reins of government into the hands of cardinal
Henry.</p>

<p>The new regent possessed much ability, and more integrity; but he was a
prelate of the church of Rome, and thought less of instructing his young
sovereign in the art of governing well, than of teaching him to revere
and defend all the superstitions of popery. He confided him to the care
of four preceptors: two of these were zealous Jesuits, and were charged
with his spiritual education: the others were noblemen of distinguished
reputation, who were to instruct their prince in history, philosophy,
and moral exercises.</p>

<p>Don Alexes de Meneses, the first of these nobles, was allied to the
Italian family of Medici, and had been nurtured at Florence, under their
auspices, in the newly-discovered learning of the ancients: having a
genius for active scenes, he devoured with avidity the works of their<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_11">{11}</a></span>
historians and poets, while he coldly perused the peaceful theories of
their philosophers. He came therefore to the task of education, with no
other aim than that of making his pupil a conqueror.</p>

<p>His coadjutor, Gonzalez de Camera, facilitated this aim. He had served
in the wars of Germany, under Sebastian’s maternal grandfather, Charles
V., and though no longer young, talked with youthful ardor of battles,
and sieges, and victories. He failed not to paint every virtue in the
justest colours; but when he spoke of those which brighten the crown of
a hero, his language set his hearer in a blaze.</p>

<p>That rapid, that resistless eloquence, which rouses the passions and
impels the will, was ever at his command: he could touch every spring of
the human heart. Sebastian’s soon learned to move solely at his
direction.</p>

<p>From such governors the character of the young monarch received an
impetus<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_12">{12}</a></span> which was fatal to its excellence. Nature had given him an
excess of sensibility, requiring the rein rather than the spur; his
virtues were of themselves too much inclined to tread a precipice: had
he fallen into the hands of men of calmer feelings, and cooler heads, he
might have risen with steady wing to the empyreal height of true glory:
as it was, he became the prey of passion, and the slave of error.</p>

<p>Years now rolled away: Portugal gradually recovered from her domestic
losses, and began to anticipate with eagerness the end of her young
sovereign’s minority: the regent himself panted for a more tranquil
station; and Don Sebastian burned to seize the sceptre Providence had
destined him to wield. At the age appointed by law, this was voluntarily
resigned to him.</p>

<p>The young monarch’s coronation was as magnificent as his spirit: all the
riches of the new world, the gold of Mexico,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_13">{13}</a></span> the diamonds of Brazil,
the pearls of Ormutz, were displayed on the persons of the nobility.
Their very horses, proudly pranced under housings of cloth of gold and
precious stones.</p>

<p>As the long procession passed from the palace to the cathedral, crouds
of spectators lining the streets and windows, easily distinguished their
prince by the superior nobleness of his air. In the very flower of his
youth Sebastian appeared mounted on a white Arabian, the trappings of
which were studded with rubies: his own ornaments were few: the order of
Christus, alone sparkled in brilliants upon his majestic chest; the rest
of his dress merely displayed without seeking to decorate the symmetry
of his figure. While passing one of his minister’s houses, some ladies
showered flowers upon him from a balcony: at this act of female
gallantry, he checked his horse, and looking up, lifted off his hat. The
air was immediately rent<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_14">{14}</a></span> with “Long live our King, Sebastian!” His
enchanting smile, the still sweeter smile of his eyes, his animated
complexion and ingenuous countenance, seemed to promise a character
which intoxicated the people: they shouted again, when again smiling
with as much gaiety as graciousness, he threw away his hat, and rode
forward uncovered. From that moment he became their idol. Such is the
effect of youth, beauty, and urbanity, in high stations!</p>

<p>At the gate of the cathedral, the cardinal Henry, attended by the
archbishop of Lisbon, and the rest of the clergy, received the King: he
was then conducted into the body of the church, where the three estates
took the oaths of fidelity, and the crown was placed on his head.
Immediately after, Sebastian went to the monastery, where his
illustrious grandmother now lived retired, in order to receive her
blessing, and to express a dutiful sense of her past kindness: he<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_15">{15}</a></span> then
returned to his palace, where he directly assumed the functions of
royalty.</p>

<p>The first acts of the young monarch’s government were calculated to
inspirit the Portuguese: his administration of justice was so impartial,
that not even those who suffered by this impartiality, ventured a
complaint: neither friend nor enemy expected from him the least bias on
their side. In his domestic relations he was generous and forgiving; but
in his public character, inflexible. By presenting the court of
judicature with a copy of the laws, abridged and transcribed by himself,
he early informed his people that nothing was so valuable in his eyes as
their rights.</p>

<p>Sebastian displayed much magnificence in his court, and infinite
liberality in his gifts; yet, he was not censurable for extravagance. By
giving splendor to his own appointments, he believed himself honoring
the nation over which he reign<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_16">{16}</a></span>ed; and by rewarding talents, he
gratified a munificent spirit, while he secured important services to
the community.</p>

<p>Impressed with an exalted notion of the <i>divine right</i> of Kings, he
would not hear that authority questioned; though indeed, he prized
absolute power, for the sake of being enabled by it to succour and to
bless others. Too keenly alive to the impressions made by his tutors,
some thirst for distinction as a warlike King, insensibly mixed with
this laudable motive: religious prejudices united to stimulate him; and
the voice of glory resounding from the depths of time, at once invited
and commanded him to seize a crown of imperishable structure.</p>

<p>His head was soon filled by visions of future greatness, and his heart
fired with holy zeal: he meditated the conquest and the conversion of
half the globe. To conquer from the mere mania for dominion, was
abhorrent even to him who felt that war would hereafter be his element;<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_17">{17}</a></span>
but when he associated with the idea of conquest, the prospect of
rescuing whole nations from “the shadow of death,” from Mahometanism or
Paganism, he gave way to military enthusiasm, and daily fired his fancy
with plans of heroic enterprize.</p>

<p>Every thing with Sebastian was a passion: his friendships, his love for
his people; nay, his religion itself; they were each, so many internal
fires which sometimes blazed out, and desolated instead of cherishing.
But as it is said, that the most fertile regions are to be found in the
neighbourhood of volcanos, so the finest qualities were connected in
Sebastian’s nature, with a dangerous ardour. He would at any time have
sacrificed his crown, his life, or what is dearer than life&#8212;his
tenderest ties, “for the sake of adding one pulse breadth to
Christendom;” he would have denied himself any gratification, if he
believed it repre<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_18">{18}</a></span>hensible in itself, or injurious to another; he was at
all times, and in all things, superior to <i>self</i>: his faults therefore,
were the sole product of the age he lived in, and the education he had
received; had he been born two centuries later, how different might have
been his character, how different his fate!</p>

<p>Embellished by many fine qualities, it was not wonderful that Sebastian,
though tinctured with imperiousness and impatience, should be generally
idolized: his people knew him only as a benefactor, and they were not
wise enough to foresee the evils which the rashness of his disposition
might produce.</p>

<p>Amongst the nobility, he lived with the freedom of gay and ingenuous
youth, trusting to the influence of his peculiar conduct for the
preservation of their respect. He shared their amusements and other
exercises, and without a single rebuke, purified their grosser habits,
by his<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_19">{19}</a></span> temperate example. The spirit of Sebastian needed no effort to
rise superior to every debasing pleasure.</p>

<p>As yet, he knew little of the female character; but he would have
disdained himself had he believed his heart capable of loving the
bondage even of love: he could enjoy the light of beauty without feeling
its fire; and though courteous to all the ladies of his court, was
particular to none.</p>

<p>Shunning delicate amusements, he affected those only which render the
frame robust, and the spirit intrepid. By every bodily exercise he
continued to accomplish his personal advantages, while he steadily fixed
his eye upon the period in which those advantages of health and strength
would become important.</p>

<p>The first object he meditated, was an expedition to Goa, from whence he
might carry conquest and Christianity over the whole of India: but
towards so remote a country, even his governors Camera and<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_20">{20}</a></span> Meneses,
declared it would be madness to turn his arms; they exhorted him to
weigh maturely the inadequacy of his present resources, and those evils
which must result to Portugal from her sovereign’s removal to such a
distance: finally, they prevailed on him to defer all military projects
till a few more years had given authority to his opinions.</p>

<p>Among the nobility by whom he was surrounded, Sebastian distinguished
Antonio, prior of Crato; who, though an illegitimate son of the late
Duke de Beja, was considered throughout Portugal as the King’s
acknowledged relation.</p>

<p>In conformity with the customs of those times, Antonio had taken the vow
of celibacy, in order to qualify him for holding the rich priory of
Crato, and the grand mastership of the knights of Malta: in other
respects he possessed nothing of the priest. Nature had endowed him with
an animating cheerfulness of disposition, to which every one resorted
for pleasure: he<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_21">{21}</a></span> was liberal of his purse, liberal even to carelessness
in his judgments; naturally indolent and indifferent in matters of
importance; but capable of catching the fever of enthusiasm from
another. This last quality gave him his influence over Sebastian.</p>

<p>The king was flattered by the appearance of having roused Antonio from a
degrading apathy: for, indeed, except in the prior’s attachment to him,
he seemed devoid of any serious feeling. Every impression left by
beauty, by accomplishments, by goodness, by wisdom, by affairs of the
state or the church, passed off from his volatile mind, like sand
drifted by the wind. He laughed and trifled with Sebastian, alternately
delighted and provoked him, for ever beguiled him with the prospect of
improvement, and for ever disappointed him: but it was this
unsubstantial character which fixed him in Sebastian’s heart. A
character which received the best impressions with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_22">{22}</a></span> most seducing
facility, yet never retained, and always lamented them, was expressly
formed to excite partial solicitude. Antonio became by degrees his
constant companion, his most intimate confidant, and at length his chief
counsellor.</p>

<p>The deaths of Meneses and Camera, which happened in the course of the
same year, greatly affected Sebastian, although these events left him
more freely to the bent of his own inclination: He could now renew his
resolution of plunging into a religious war, without apprehension of
being restrained by opinions to which he was used to yield. The habit of
believing this resolution highly meritorious, had given some
imperiousness to his mode of carrying it into execution; and he could
not always conceal his disdain for such persons as represented that no
zeal for general good, should make him risk the particular good of his
own subjects. But towards Antonio, he turned with redoubled favor; for
Antonio warmly<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_23">{23}</a></span> embraced the revived projects, offering to accompany him
into Africa, a country now become the object of his contemplation.</p>

<p>The Moors, though driven out of Spain, still continued to increase in
strength and dominion among the mountains of Barbary: they frequently
attacked the fortresses belonging to Portugal, which remained to her
upon their coast, and not only treated the prisoners made in these
engagements with extreme rigour, but terrified or seduced some of them
into the profession of their impious faith. Sebastian meditated the
destruction of this growing power: he communicated his design to Antonio
alone, who consented to become his companion in a secret excursion to
the fortress of Tangier, from whence they might gather certain
information of the nature and the resources of the Mauritanian states.</p>

<p>As it was the young king’s wish to avoid controversy with his ministers,
by<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_24">{24}</a></span> keeping the whole affair secret till he had reconnoitred Africa, Don
Antonio was directed to make private arrangements for their conveyance
beyond sea, while under the pretence of a hunting match, he should draw
together all the young lords likely to embrace their enterprize.</p>

<p>Gallantly provided, those favorite nobles met their sovereign in the
province of Algarve, where he disclosed his project of crossing over
immediately into Africa. Smit with the phrensy of chevalric adventure,
every one consented to embark their fates with those of their King; and
rather to incur the chance of being taken prisoners by the Moors, than
shrink from danger when it might lead to glory.</p>

<p>They set sail in a single vessel badly manned and worse armed; but to a
band of rash young men, whose leader was still younger, and more
adventurous than themselves, even hazard had charms.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_25">{25}</a></span> After a short
voyage, they landed safely at Tangier.</p>

<p>Sebastian was no sooner upon African ground, than he began to prosecute
his enquiries with equal vigour and ability: he learnt the military
force and resources of the Moors, their points of weakness and of
strength, their system of war and of government, the nature of their
troops, and the topography of their country; he ransomed several
Christians who had long languished in slavery, and from their accounts
of the Moorish princes began to hope that in their contests for
supremacy, he might reap solid advantage.</p>

<p>Having thoroughly acquainted himself with these important subjects, the
King hastened his re-embarkation: flushed with the conviction of being
now able to bear down every cautionary suggestion of his counsellors, by
arguments drawn from actual observation of the country he was going to
invade. After a short absence<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_26">{26}</a></span> he set sail again with his followers for
the shores of Portugal.</p>

<p>In mid sea they met and engaged a Turkish vessel. The Turk was greatly
superior in size and force; but a band of brave spirits animated into
heroes by the example of their King, were not to be conquered by common
efforts, Sebastian fought like a roused lion; he fought for the first
time; he fought for the lives and liberties of men whom his rashness had
endangered; he fought too for honour, and he fought against infidels.
After a long and fierce resistance, the Turk struck his flag, and
Sebastian ordered the ensign of the cross, to take its place. His heart
hailed an omen which promised victory over Mahomet.</p>

<p>Elated with conquest, the royal galliot proceeded direct for Lisbon: as
they were entering the mouth of the Tagus, a sudden storm arose, and for
some hours Sebastian beheld death approaching in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_27">{27}</a></span> more appalling shape
than when dimly seen among the flashing of arms. But his courage did not
desert him even then: nay, it shone with steadier brightness as the
danger darkened. By remaining undismayed himself, he recalled the
energies of others. Every effort and activity were exerted; and it
proved ultimately successful: they rode out the storm in safety through
a starless night, and the next morning were seen entering the Tagus in
triumph with their prize.</p>

<p>The return of their beloved prince thus accompanied, circulated extreme
joy throughout Lisbon:&#8212;in his safety and his conquest, the boyish
imprudence of his conduct was forgotten, and exultation alone appeared
on the faces of the Portuguese. But alas! this exultation was quickly
swallowed up in horror; for the plague, which during the King’s absence
had appeared in several provinces, now broke out in the city, and swept
away thousands with resistless fury.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_28">{28}</a></span></p>

<p>Sebastian’s strenuous exertions were applied to stop the progress of
this calamity: he refused to abandon his capital, confidently reposing
on the protection of heaven, while engaged in the performance of a duty.
Often was this youthful father of his people seen passing from house to
house, to witness the execution of the orders he issued for the relief
of his suffering subjects: often was he seen to weep over domestic
wounds, which not even the hand of a munificent prince could heal.</p>

<p>When the contagion had exhausted its rage, and the few remaining
inhabitants awoke from their stupefaction, the King’s safety became a
miracle in their eyes: and Sebastian himself, recollecting his conquest
over the infidel and the tempest, believed his life preserved for some
admirable purpose.</p>

<p>It was with bitter regret that he now saw his African enterprize
frustrated for awhile: his dominions wasted by sickness,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_29">{29}</a></span> and enfeebled
by terror, were not capable of affording him those supplies, necessary
to success; he therefore laid aside the plan, and went with his cousin
Antonio, to recover from their fatigue and mortification among the
romantic scenes of the prior’s residence near Crato.</p>

<p>It was in this enchanting retreat that he was startled by a proposal
from his first minister, for his marriage with a princess of France.
Though Sebastian treated the idea of love (such as he saw it amongst his
young courtiers,) with infinite scorn, and wondered how a man’s heart
could find room for any other passion than glory, he had at this moment
a confused idea, that preference at least, was necessary to make the
marriage yoke pleasant, or light. He hastily caught up the miniature of
the lady (which had been sent with the proposal,) and looked earnestly
at it: the next instant he threw it away, exclaiming with his usual
impetuosity, “<span class="lftspc">’</span>tis a peevish, <i>little-souled</i> face,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_30">{30}</a></span> and I would not
marry the original if she had all France for her dowry.”</p>

<p>Antonio took up the picture, and eyed it with some admiration&#8212;“and pray
my good, insensible cousin,” he said, “what wouldst thou have?&#8212;here is
a very pretty neck, a skin like roses and lilies, a delicate mouth,
tolerable eyes!&#8212;the princess is, I dare say, a charming little doll,
with which a man might amuse himself very agreeably, when he had nothing
else to do.”</p>

<p>“But I shall always have something else to do,” replied Sebastian, “I
cannot bear the thought of having a contemptible play-thing for a wife;
yet I should despise myself were I ever to be fascinated by any woman
into the servile bondage of love,&#8212;no; you must all wait <i>my</i> time: I
shall marry some day; but I swear by Heaven, not before I have combatted
the infidels on their own ground.”</p>

<p>“That is a very foolish vow,” observed Antonio, “and I’d have you recal
it.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_31">{31}</a></span>”</p>

<p>“Never!” exclaimed the King, “never!” (and while he spoke, his eyes
lightened with youthful ardour) “you know my character Antonio; it is
formed of tougher materials than yours, it does not easily bend even to
necessity. Though our exhausted country now is fainting before us, she
will revive, she will recover; and then, strong in a divine cause,
conscious of no motive beyond the love of mankind, (whose bodies these
accursed Mahometans torture in slavery, and whose souls they draw into
everlasting perdition,) I will advance under the banner of the cross,
confident of victory.&#8212;What is it I seek?&#8212;not dominion, not power, nor
the mere name of conqueror? I combat for the <i>eternal</i> good of the human
race: I pant after no earthly honour; except indeed the proud
distinction of having extirpated the enemies of Christ.”</p>

<p>“That is all, very admirable, and very true, my royal cousin,” replied
the prior, “but as neither priests nor laymen<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_32">{32}</a></span> can pretend to read the
will of Heaven, we must not be quite so confident of success, at least
you should conceive the possibility of your being ordained, (which God
forbid!) to fall in the very moment of triumph, purchasing with your
blood the saintly distinction to which you aspire.” The young King who
was traversing the apartment, turned quickly round at this; transported
with the dazzling thought his enthusiastic spirit blazed on his face; he
looked at his cousin with rapture. “Such a death!&#8212;Antonio, would you
not envy such a death?”</p>

<p>“Not in the least,” replied the prior gaily, “you must excuse me if I
pray for a very different end for us both.&#8212;But if <i>you</i> are bent upon
thus expiring like the Phœnix amidst the cloves and cinnamon of glory,
suffer me to remind you, that Portugal will then have reason to lament
the princess of France’s peevish countenance, and her monarch’s
imprudent vow.”</p>

<p>Sebastian was struck with the observa<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_33">{33}</a></span>tion: after a pause he said, “you
are right; yet I am not inclined to retract. While I study the happiness
of my people, surely it is not required of me to sacrifice my
own?&#8212;Though at this instant, I could contentedly take the vow of
celibacy to please them (if that were necessary for any good purpose,) I
do not find in myself a disposition to embitter my domestic life merely
for the sake of leaving them an heir to my crown.&#8212;I can imagine
infinite happiness with a wife suited to my taste, consonant with my
principles, and capable of catching some of my own wild-fire; and I feel
a jealous something in my breast&#8212;call it pride, call it delicacy, what
you will, but it is a sentiment of abhorrence at the thought of
cherishing a woman who would have consented to fill the arms of any
other King that might have sat on the throne of Portugal.&#8212;For this
reason I cannot, I will not marry one to whom I am personally
unknown&#8212;this is my determination, car<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_34">{34}</a></span>ry it to Alcoçava, and let him
manage the refusal with the customary decorum.”</p>

<p>After a little good-humoured raillery, Antonio prepared to set out for
Lisbon, and the King, without suffering any one to attend him, mounted a
horse and rode forth.</p>

<p>His spirit was disturbed by that prevalent anxiety for his marriage,
which his ministry had urged in support of their late proposal; and it
was saddened by the small prospect there was, of his being speedily able
to realize the darling wish that had grown with his growth, and
strengthened with his strength. Disinterested as he firmly believed
himself, and purely actuated by zeal for the holy faith, yet he could
not conceal from his own conscience, that a boundless ambition of fame,
had its share in regretting the delay of his purposed expedition: the
enfeebled state of his dominions had prevented him from contributing any
assis<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_35">{35}</a></span>tance to the grand coalition then forming against the Turks&#8212;and
the splendid success of that coalition, deepened his chagrin. The
victory of Lepanto haunted his nightly dreams; he secretly repined at
the thick laurels of Don John of Austria; painfully contrasting that
young admiral’s achievements, with his own blighted and withering hopes.</p>

<p>Wearied with thought and motion, Sebastian threw himself off his horse
in a solitary spot surrounded by hills, and suffering him to graze at
will, cast himself along under a shade of cork trees; there he mused
over ten thousand new prospects of vain and impracticable enterprize.</p>

<p>The sultry air was cooled and perfumed by the breathing of aromatic
plants, kept in all the greenness of spring, by several rills which
trickled almost unseen beneath them; not a breeze stirred the leaves of
the cork trees, and the very birds were silent: the only sound to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_36">{36}</a></span>
heard throughout the valley, was the lulling murmur of bees coming to
feed upon the flowers. A steady heat glowed in the air: Sebastian cast
aside his mantle and his hat, and pushed away the hair from his
forehead; all the summer burned upon his cheek, but a hotter fire, the
fever of impatience was in his heart.&#8212;By degrees the enervating warmth
overpowered him, and he sunk into sleep.</p>

<p>He had not reposed long, when his slumbers were dispersed by the sound
of steps and a voice; he opened his eyes; at that instant a goat twisted
with flowers, and dragging along a half finished garland, bounded past
with a suddenness which made the King start up.&#8212;The wanton animal was
swiftly followed by a young virgin, who stopt confounded at sight of a
man: part of her veil was off, and filled with the flowers she had been
employed in arranging, and a profusion of bright golden hair,
picturesquely disordered by the heat and the pursuit, was<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_37">{37}</a></span> scattered on
a neck that sparkled in the sun like alabaster. The eagerness of her
feelings had heightened the lustre of her beauty to such perfection,
that Sebastian almost believed the object before him a celestial vision.
The blue glory of her eyes, the glittering bloom of her complexion, the
gracefulness of her attitude, and the animation of her whole person,
gave him for the first time in his life a complete idea of female
charms.</p>

<p>Abashed and surprised by an exclamation which escaped him, the fair
stranger turned blushing away, hastily endeavouring to cover herself
with her veil.</p>

<p>Sebastian pointed to the goat now trailing his fantastic trappings along
the ridge of a steep height&#8212;“You will not go, fair creature! he said,
till you have given me permission to attempt the recovery of yon
runaway?”</p>

<p>Fresh beauty was diffused over the exquisite features of the lady, while
she willingly essayed to thank him: “I have<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_38">{38}</a></span> imprudently ventured too
far beyond my father’s park, she added, or you would not see me thus
unattended sir. I ought not to remain here with a stranger perhaps, but
your countenance insures me respect, and I think, I hope, I am not wrong
in accepting your services!”</p>

<p>The King now led her to the shade, where she seated herself, while he
ascended a neighbouring hill, and soon returned with the goat: at the
playful chiding of its lovely mistress, the little animal lay down in
seeming penitence beside her, suffering Sebastian to caress, and hold it
prisoner. The panting fatigue of Donna Gonsalva, and the peculiar
freshness of the air in the valley, afforded him a plausible excuse for
seeking to detain her: Gonsalva herself, flattered with the admiration
she inspired, was in no haste to recover. She was struck with the noble
air of her companion, and felt some womanish curiosity about his name
and rank: but Sebastian, desirous of concealing him<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_39">{39}</a></span>self, without
anticipating any further acquaintance, avoided her questions. He found
from her own account, that she was the only daughter of the count
Vimiosa, (his envoy at the court of France,) and was then inhabiting the
family mansion, under the protection of a maiden aunt.</p>

<p>An abundance of enchanting gaiety led Gonsalva into unreserved
conversation: she rallied the King upon the solitude in which she had
found him, and with arch <i>naiveté</i> told him she should never in future
address her saint without remembering to pray for the <i>gallant
solitary</i>. “But by what name shall I pray for him?” asked she, rising to
depart: the King hesitated; as he was born upon the eve of the joint
feast of two Saints, he believed himself entitled to the name of either,
so bid her remember him by the title of Don Fabian.</p>

<p>Donna Gonsalva repeated the words. “I shall not forget you; said she,
re<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_40">{40}</a></span>member me, when you look at this flower, that will be just five
minutes, for it is withering now.” She threw him a lily out of her bosom
with a smile of such magic beauty, that Sebastian could not refrain from
snatching the fair hand which dropped the flower, and printing it
lightly with a kiss. Gonsalva drew away her hand in displeasure. Would
she have done so, had she known that this was the first kiss those lips
had given to beauty, and that it was the King of Portugal who gave it?</p>

<p>She disappeared the next moment, leaving Sebastian endeavouring to rally
himself upon so unusual an impulse of gallantry.</p>

<p>The beautiful Portuguese had successfully dispersed the young monarch’s
gloom; it did not return: he loitered awhile longer in the scene where
he had beheld her, then seeking his horse, returned to Crato.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_41">{41}</a></span></p>

<h2><a id="CHAP_II"></a>CHAP. II.</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">As</span> Antonio had business to transact for the King with his cabinet, he
did not return immediately from Lisbon, and Sebastian having visited him
without any of his favorite Lords, was now thrown principally upon his
own resources for amusement. The weather was too hot for hunting or
tennis, reading stirred his ardent spirit too violently, and he was not
in the mood for general society; the next day therefore, he naturally
thought of the last day’s agreeable adventure: without absolutely
proposing to do so, he rode out again unattended.</p>

<p>On reaching the pass leading into the valley, he left his horse in
charge with a goatherd who was stationed there to watch some flocks, and
pursued his way on foot. The heat was moderated by a slight shower which
had refreshed the verdant land<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_42">{42}</a></span>scape, and now the birds sung from every
copse: but the scene wanted the presence of Gonsalva; she was not there.
Sebastian mechanically followed the track he had seen her take, and
descending the opposite side of a steep hill, saw stretched out before
him, a luxuriant and extensive vale, in which the villa and domain of
Vimiosa, were nobly conspicuous.</p>

<p>Proceeding through a thicket of evergreen oaks, the King soon found
himself in a labyrinth of walks; he chose one at a venture, and fortune
destined it should lead him to the entrance of a bower, where stood the
fair subject of his thoughts, occupied in reading a letter.</p>

<p>At sight of him, roseate blushes succeeded by entrancing smiles, passed
over her face. “Don Fabian!” she exclaimed, “for Heaven’s sake what
brings you here?”</p>

<p>The question was unlucky, as it was the only one perhaps, which the King
could not answer satisfactorily to himself,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_43">{43}</a></span> he looked at her,
hesitated, felt embarrassed, and at length said timidly, “to ask
forgiveness I believe, for the fault I committed yesterday.”</p>

<p>Donna Gonsalva now remembered that she had left him in anger. “So then,
you have the boldness to encrease that fault by following me into a
place, where if you were to be seen, it might cost you your life; me, my
reputation and peace of mind!&#8212;for pity’s sake, do not stay here&#8212;I
expect&#8212;I expect one of my relations every instant&#8212;should he see you&#8212;a
stranger&#8212;-go, for Heaven’s sake go!”&#8212;As the beautiful Portuguese
spoke, she unconsciously grasped his arm with her hand, and impelled him
towards the mountains.</p>

<p>Sebastian’s heart, for the first moment in his life, throbbed with a
tender emotion, nearly a-kin to love: he understood nothing in this
speech but a desire for his preservation; and he knew himself unknown:
It was not the King of Portugal<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_44">{44}</a></span> then, but an obscure stranger, whom the
daughter of the count Vimiosa was thus solicitous to save. “Ah, charming
Gonsalva,” he cried with an air of mental intoxication, “if you are as
amiable as you appear, the wishes of”&#8212;my people, he was going to add,
but checking the indiscreet expression, he finished the sentence with a
sigh.</p>

<p>An excess of pleasure brightened the beauty of Gonsalva; she averted her
eyes to conceal it, while she repeated an intreaty that he would
consider the impropriety of her being discovered in conversation with a
young nobleman unknown to her family. Sebastian still lingered: “you
must not refuse me another meeting!”&#8212;he said; and he said it with the
air of a man to whom command is habitual, and refusal a novelty.</p>

<p>“I must not!” repeated Gonsalva, laughing, “do you remember, Don Fabian,
that you are speaking to a woman&#8212;and that woman the daughter of the
count<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_45">{45}</a></span> Vimiosa?&#8212;our sex are not accustomed to yield, even the slightest
favors, at the mere expression of an ardent wish; we must be sued to
submissively.”</p>

<p>“Submission is my abhorrence!” exclaimed the young monarch with
vivacity, “I feel now, and for the first time in my life, that I can
admire, I can prize, I can love, perhaps; but you must not expect me to
renounce equality with the object. I must have heart for heart, I must
excite as many tender apprehensions as I feel, or&#8212;”</p>

<p>“And who are you, that can never speak without an <i>I must</i>:” exclaimed
Gonsalva, laughing excessively&#8212;“but I have not time to hear your
answer, leave me I say&#8212;we may perhaps meet again, and then&#8212;I hear
footsteps&#8212;farewell count.”&#8212;She turned abruptly into a side path, and
Sebastian desirous of remaining unknown, hastened out of the domain.</p>

<p>He was no sooner at a distance from the villa Vimiosa, than he began to
muse<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_46">{46}</a></span> over the confession of admiration into which he had been hurried,
and to dwell with extreme pleasure on the concluding words of Gonsalva,
as they certainly intimated a wish to see him again. In less than an
hour, a complete set of new ideas had taken possession of his mind: the
conversation with Don Antonio, and the wish of his people, blending with
the image of Donna Gonsalva, awakened in his bosom an emotion hitherto
unknown; but an emotion too sweet and subtle for rejection. The
adventure itself had the charm of novelty; as for the first time in his
life he beheld a young and lovely woman, who so far from dreaming of his
rank, believed herself his superior. Amongst the ladies of the court he
had seen beauty, but it was beauty divested of its most touching graces,
the play of innocent freedom: he had never met with one who did not
appear emulous to attract the King’s notice; and as he possessed too
much delicacy to bear the thought<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_47">{47}</a></span> of owing any thing to an exalted
station, he despised and avoided their homage.</p>

<p>Occupied solely with the romantic reveries of an amiable, though erring
ambition, he had hitherto felt without reasoning upon the subject, that
he had no time for love; conscious that whenever he yielded to that
sentiment it would influence his happiness entirely. Here, now, was the
only opportunity that might ever present itself for acquiring a female
heart, without the hateful aid of royalty; here was an opportunity of
gratifying his people without mortifying his own feelings. The prospect
of arms and victories, no longer filled the void of his capacious soul,
and how could he better console himself for this, than by trying to
accommodate his private inclinations with those of his subjects?</p>

<p>The extreme beauty and graceful gaiety of Donna Gonsalva delighted the
senses of Sebastian; he hoped to find her equally charming in mind and
heart: above all he<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_48">{48}</a></span> passionately desired to make her love him. With the
inperiousness of a King, he resolved to reign absolute over her
affections, to have his power avowed and submitted to, or not to reign
at all: he determined to be preferred as Don Fabian, before he should be
known as Sebastian. Every thing promised success to this romantic
resolution; and the more he reflected on it the more he was confirmed in
the intention of concealing his real rank from Gonsalva; as she lived
much secluded, and at some miles distance from Crato, discovery was
unlikely, besides which, the clandestine nature of their intercourse
rendered enquiries on her part almost impossible.</p>

<p>Satisfied with these mental arrangements, the King rode gaily home,
forgetful of the foolish vow he had taken; treading lightly on the
delightful precincts of Love, whose first prospects are like “the
opening of Heaven’s everlasting gates, on golden hinges turning.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_49">{49}</a></span>”&#8212;</p>

<p>He finished the day amongst his young nobles, with uncommon animation.</p>

<p>The prior of Crato was expected the next morning: Sebastian saw day
dawn, after passing a night of sweet wakefulness, during which the image
of Donna Gonsalva had floated perpetually before him. Eager to behold
her in reality, ere the return of his cousin, the King withdrew early
from his attending lords, and took the road to Vimiosa.</p>

<p>As he was proceeding to enter the path through the thicket, he saw
Gonsalva at a distance, in another part of the domain, walking on a
terrace, cut on the side of a hill, that overlooked the house; he
hastened thither, but perceiving that she had a female companion,
retreated and placed himself under the boughs of a tree. The ladies
turned, and walked towards him: as they approached, his heart beat with
an anxiety that surprized himself; <i>if Gonsalva should not see him</i>! he
shook the branches of the tree with a trembling<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_50">{50}</a></span> hand, at which she
started and put aside her veil. The same bright glow of pleasure
irradiated her effulgent beauty, the same smile that had charmed away
the reason of Sebastian, again transported him; but she dropped her
veil, and passed on without speaking.</p>

<p>After taking several turns together, the ladies separated: the aunt of
Gonsalva descended a flight of steps over which the trees hung so thick,
as soon to exclude her from sight, while her fair niece at first
advanced towards the grove which concealed Sebastian, and then
capriciously struck into a path sloping directly from him.</p>

<p>The impetuous monarch disturbed at the thought of her departure, sprang
forward, intreating that she would stay. Gonsalva half turned
round&#8212;“So, you are here again my good friend?”&#8212;she said, in a tone of
careless gaiety which her sparkling looks contradicted,&#8212;“are you come
to teach me another lesson out of<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_51">{51}</a></span> your new catechism of female
subjection?&#8212;let me tell you that air of authority that you have, is
abominably provoking, and I should like vastly to break its neck: one
grain of humility would make you&#8212;not absolutely hateful.”</p>

<p>“You shall find me humbler to you, than to any other being in the
world;” replied Sebastian smiling, “if you will but strive to think of
me with tenderness.” Gonsalva laughed. “What a pleasant madman chance
has introduced me to!&#8212;upon what do you ground these extravagant
pretensions? pretensions too, so insolently urged! did you never read
the Spanish author, who calls <i>Love, that courteous affront offered to
beauty</i>?&#8212;prithee con over his definition and profit by it. Think of you
with tenderness! why, my presumptuous friend, if I think of you at all
in any way ’tis more than you should expect. Think of you with
tenderness, when all I know of you is that you have a tolerable figure,
which<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_52">{52}</a></span> sillier women than myself may have persuaded you is
irresistible!&#8212;A potentate could not woo with more authority.”</p>

<p>The accidentally penetrating glance of her eyes while speaking these
words, so confounded Sebastian, that it made the blood mantle on his
cheeks, she laughed again. “Come, this is the colouring of penitence, so
I must not chide you any more. Never let me hear a presumptuous word
breathed, consent to be docile as a lamb, and I may condescend to be so
much interested in you as to ask you, who you are? whence you come! and
whither you go?”</p>

<p>During this discourse Donna Gonsalva had entered a path leading off the
terrace, and they were now advancing through an olive plantation which
effectually secured them from observation. Sebastian was encouraged by
her arch freedom: “Whence I come, and whither I go, fair Gonsalva,” he
said, “matters not; what I am, you shall know. I am a soldier: one<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_53">{53}</a></span> that
hitherto had no other passion than glory; one that never yet bowed
either heart or knee to beauty. If you see honour and honesty in my
countenance, believe me when I swear that neither my rank nor fortune
are unworthy of the count Vimiosa’s heiress: but ask me no further;
imperious circumstances render me mysterious. Suffer me to see you,
suffer me to attempt winning <i>your</i> heart, and losing <i>my own</i>, and
then,”&#8212;“O ye saints!” interrupted Gonsalva, “what excess of gallantry!
So&#8212;you have not <i>lost your</i> heart yet! but wait most obsequiously for
the surrender of mine! I protest count, or duke, or whatever you are,
you have a very taking way of making love! This cloven foot of arbitrary
insolence is for ever shewing itself: I have a shrewd notion you are one
of our young King’s attendants, and have caught his character?” “And
what is the King’s character?” asked Sebastian smiling. “An excellent
one for a King, doubtless,” replied Gonsalva. “He<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_54">{54}</a></span> thinks of nothing but
rule and dominion, breathes nothing but war and devastation, and would
fancy himself <i>un-kinged</i> if he were to yield an <i>iota</i> to a woman. All
the court ladies love him mortally, and hate him mortally: they are
charmed by his accomplishments, but piqued at his coldness. I have heard
some of them say so repeatedly. Give him the world to reign over, and he
would not care if there was not a woman in it.”</p>

<p>Sebastian did not reply: he was momentarily lost in rumination upon the
injustice done to his actions by mistaking their motives. It was evident
that Gonsalva had learned his character from report, and spoke therefore
the prevailing opinion. After a pause he said, “I have been told that
Don Sebastian young as he is, cannot be justly taxed with a thirst for
mere power; he is <i>said</i> to be actuated by zeal for our holy faith.”</p>

<p>“<i>You know</i> it perhaps?” rejoined Gonsalva playfully. “Come, come,
confess<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_55">{55}</a></span> that you are one of his court. I hear his majesty is at Crato
with Don Antonio, and of course some of his lords must be in attendance
on him.”</p>

<p>“Well then,” replied Sebastian, “I may frankly own that I came with the
King, and must return with him to Lisbon. My visits here are secret; Don
Sebastian has always expressed such disdain at lovers, that if he knew
me capable of humbling myself to such a merciless tyrant as your fair
self, I fear he would blush for my altered sentiments. Allow me to hope,
charming Gonsalva, that you will permit me to see you here again at this
hour to-morrow? The King will soon return to Lisbon, and then I shall
see you no more.”</p>

<p>Sebastian pronounced the last words with a sigh, and anxiously looked on
the heavenly features of Gonsalva for an expression of answering regret:
those heavenly features were as usual brilliant with delight; her heart
did not appear touch<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_56">{56}</a></span>ed by the intimation of this separation. “Do you
see that tower yonder?” she asked, pointing to a part of the house which
rose above some trees&#8212;“my apartments are there: under the tower-window
passes a neglected path half choaked with shrubs, where if you chuse to
ramble and take the chance of seeing me, and being noticed, I shall not
command you away. A short excursion by moonlight will do you no harm:
but mark me&#8212;no serenading.”</p>

<p>“Then it is at night I am to expect the happiness of seeing you?”</p>

<p>“Have I not told you, not to <i>expect</i> any thing? if you won’t consent to
take even trifles as unlooked-for favors, you will lose my friendship. I
<i>will</i> be absolute in my way; a very counterpart of your royal master.
Fare you well, Don Fabian, if you should miss seeing me at my window,
take this as a complete adieu: and, do you hear, when you return to
Lisbon, do set about curing both your<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_57">{57}</a></span>self and the King, of your
abominable insolence.”</p>

<p>Away flew the volatile beauty with the grace of a nymph, leaving
Sebastian pierced with pains which he dreaded to analyze; too certain
they were occasioned by her seeming indifference. Something like
resentment swelled his proud heart as he recalled the tenderness of his
parting manner, and the carelessness of hers: he felt as if he had been
duped; and execrated himself for having yielded even momentarily to a
weakness which had thus sunk him into the play-thing of a coquet. To
have gained gently upon her affections, and fanned an infant fire with
the softest breath of respectful love, had been the aim of his wishes;
but to worship an idol without a heart, feed an inhuman deity with
groans and tears, to dote on what he could not esteem, was a meanness he
scorned.</p>

<p>“You <i>have</i> seen me for the last time, insensible Gonsalva!” he
exclaimed, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_58">{58}</a></span> turning from the view of the tower, he rushed towards the
mountains.</p>

<p>Vexed at himself, and irritated with disappointment, he rode to Crato in
a mood that clouded his physiognomy. The prior was waiting his return:
Sebastian scarcely noticing him, seized a bundle of dispatches sent from
one of his ministers, and began to read them eagerly. Don Antonio
ventured a jocular remark upon his disturbed countenance.</p>

<p>“I am in an ill-humour cousin,” replied the King, “in a rage at my own
conduct; and at this moment could tear up the roots of earth
itself.”&#8212;Antonio expressed some astonishment and more curiosity:
Sebastian declined satisfying it, adding, “I have quite enough to bear,
cousin, when I have my own contempt to encounter, without seeking the
addition of yours. Let this squall of temper have its way&#8212;for heaven’s
sake talk with me of business, news, nonsense, any thing<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_59">{59}</a></span>&#8212;change the
current of my thoughts if possible.&#8212;What said Alcoçava and the cardinal
to my refusal of the Frenchwoman?”</p>

<p>“Since you require me to change the current of your thoughts, and thus
lead to the subject of love and marriage, I may conclude the
mischief-making God has had no hand in raising the present storm?”&#8212;Don
Antonio spoke this with a forced smile, and not without hesitation; yet
he fixed his eyes earnestly upon those of his cousin: the ingenuous
countenance of the latter was immediately crimsoned over; he turned
away, uttering an exclamation of contempt, coupled with the idea of
love, and abruptly entered on another topic. The prior surprized and
disturbed, appeared somewhat hurt at the King’s reserve, for he became
thoughtful, and supported conversation with less spirit than was usual
with him; but at length this mutual restraint wore off, and the
remainder of the day was spent in all the freedom of friendship.</p>

<p>Sebastian’s resolution to avoid Gonsalva,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_60">{60}</a></span> lasted rather longer than his
indignation. By degrees the flattering parts of her manner came oftener
to his memory than those gay airs of indifference which had mortified
his too sanguine nature: the agitating blush, the hope-awakening smile
haunted his day-dreams; sometimes he saw her in the visions of the
night, yielding him one of those tresses like the morn, which shaded her
ivory neck, and half-averting a cheek now glowing with the sensibility
of a melting heart.&#8212;He awoke, but the seducing image still swam before
him.</p>

<p>Sebastian then revolved the probability of his having judged hastily and
harshly: delicacy alone, or love distrustful of its empire, might have
dictated that sprightly carelessness which had shocked him: though she
had said they might not meet again, she did not perhaps think so, nor
mean him to seek for her in vain at her window; would it not be well
then, to make another essay to observe the effect of his absence? the
youthful lover decided in the affirmative.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_61">{61}</a></span></p>

<p>Being unexpectedly summoned by state affairs to his capital, he
determined to make a last trial of Gonsalva’s sentiments, by visiting
her on the night before his departure. When that night came, he excused
himself from the amusements of his courtiers, and leaving Don Antonio
chained down to a game of chess, he glided away unobserved, and was soon
conveyed by his swiftest horse to the domain of Vimiosa.</p>

<p>A soft moonlight distinctly discovered the spot to which Gonsalva had
directed him six days before. He saw the steep romantic bank shading the
road towards which he now turned his steps: as he trod it lightly, the
smell of orange flowers and wild thyme, came mingling from the hills and
the gardens. While his eyes were fixed on the windows of the tower,
where perhaps Gonsalva slept, some low tender sounds caught his ear: he
listened, but they had ceased; the next moment they returned again;
drawing gently nearer he found they proceeded from a lute which some
one<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_62">{62}</a></span> was touching at intervals with an unsteady hand, another pause
succeeded: he stood still, and scarcely respired; for now the voice of
Gonsalva was heard singing this canzonet.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Hast thou, a sleepless pillow prest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And vainly, vainly sought for rest?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah! say, have sighs and tears confess’d<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That love was kindling in thy breast?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Alas! if not, why dost thou fly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To haunt my gate, my path, mine eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still looking as thou wanderest nigh<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A world of fond idolatry?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O cease, if vanity should be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The only aim that leads to me;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O cease, while yet my heart is free<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From hope, and fear, and love, and thee!”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Rapt, enchanted, Sebastian stood listening to this celestial voice: its
thrilling tones revolving in continual sweetness but endless variety,
were like the melodious warblings of a nightingale. The serene Heavens,
the resplendent moonlight, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_63">{63}</a></span> fragrance of the earth, the transport
and the gratitude of his own heart, all conspired to heighten its
magical effect. Donna Gonsalva had evidently chosen this song because it
pourtrayed a situation like her own; this thought finished the
intoxication of Sebastian, and he vehemently exclaimed, “Angel!”</p>

<p>At this expression, Gonsalva dropped her lute, and flying forward,
uttered a cry of pleasure. “Ah, is it you, ungrateful Fabian!” she
cried: her beauty and her emotion completed the conquest over her
sovereign. She was without a veil, and he now beheld for the first time,
all the charms of that matchless face: traces of tears were on it.</p>

<p>Scarcely conscious of the extreme joy he betrayed, the king uttered a
passionate expression at this visible mark of sensibility; and forcing
his way up the bank through shrubs and roots of trees, got sufficiently
near the object of his tenderness to kiss her hand from the window.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_64">{64}</a></span> The
night breeze blowing among his fine hair, and the moon beams falling on
his white forehead, gave lustre and animation to the noblest countenance
that ever yet united sublimity with beauty: Donna Gonsalva evidently
beheld him with admiration.</p>

<p>Endeavouring to recover from the effects of her surprize, she attempted
to answer his ardent assurances of repentance and gratitude, by light
railleries: She acknowledged that she had been in tears, but would not
confess that his absence was their cause: Sometimes she spoke in a tone
of touching sensibility, then suddenly flew off into sallies of gaiety:
her air and her words were at variance. Sebastian, though little skilled
in the science of woman’s heart, could not help perceiving the whimsical
inconsistencies of Gonsalva: while her voice fluttered, her complexion
glowed, her eyes sparkled, she persisted in assuring him that he had
never once entered her thoughts since<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_65">{65}</a></span> they parted, and that even now,
if his ridiculous speeches did not amuse her excessively, she would not
stay a second moment at the window.</p>

<p>It was in vain she asserted this: the delighted lover assured her in
return, that the stratagem of insincerity was fruitless. Since he was
resolved to win the heart, she seemed determined not to surrender.&#8212;“And
if you were to take it by storm, (as I perceive that is your mode of
conquering,)” replied Gonsalva, “what would it avail? You know,
daughters are not allowed to dispose of themselves: I have a father, Don
Fabian, and it is from his hand I must take my husband.”</p>

<p>Sebastian gazed on her enamoured, smiling with the consciousness of
sovereign power: “Let us not talk of fathers, fair Gonsalva; were I
beloved, I should fear nothing: what will not a joyful and ardent
passion accomplish? Do not deny me then the hope of having interested
you?&#8212;I must quit Crato to-<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_66">{66}</a></span>morrow; the King is recalled by important
business, and I cannot remain behind.”</p>

<p>“O! how much you are in love!” exclaimed Gonsalva, with an air of tender
reproach, “you profess to live only in my sight, and yet you can leave
me merely for the sake of preserving an empty honor about the King!”</p>

<p>The gratified Sebastian protested that nothing but a sense of duty could
make him forego the delight of these stolen interviews, which he would
hasten to renew; promising soon to return. “Till that blissful moment,
let this remind you of Fabian,” said he, (unloosing from his neck a
brilliant cross of the order of Christus which had hitherto been
concealed by his vest.) “Let this <i>assure</i> you, that your lover is
noble.”</p>

<p>“And if he were not”&#8212;exclaimed Gonsalva, stopping and ending the
sentence with a tender sigh. The triumph of Sebastian was now complete:
“and if he<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_67">{67}</a></span> were not, charming Gonsalva, you would not cease to bid him
hope?&#8212;Dare I flatter myself that such was the sentiment your modesty
deprived me of?”&#8212;Gonsalva bowed her fair neck without speaking, while
rapture sparkled in her eyes: the King lightly threw over her head the
embroidered ribbon by which the order was suspended, and when he did so,
lifted some of the tresses of her hair to his lips. “Might I bear away
with me one of these glittering ringlets!&#8212;Surely you will not deny me
the precious gift?”</p>

<p>A faint denial only served to stimulate the young monarch, Gonsalva
refused, and chided, and jested, but yielded at last.</p>

<p>At parting, the coy beauty would not utter a confession of regret,
though she suffered the sentiment to appear in her swimming eyes.
Sebastian was perhaps more enamoured by this conduct: the difficulty of
subduing so haughty or so delicate a heart, gave additional pleasure<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_68">{68}</a></span> to
the attempt; and the spirit of domination then mixed with the tender
desires of love. He returned to Crato with his golden prize, believing
himself a conqueror when he was in reality a slave.</p>

<p>The vivacity of Sebastian’s feelings were in proportion to their
novelty: he loved for the first time, therefore he loved with his whole
soul; and the idea of being beloved in return, <i>for his own sake</i>,
finished the enchantment.</p>

<p>During their rapid journey to Lisbon, he disclosed the romantic secret
to his cousin.</p>

<p>Though Don Antonio was evidently too discreet for the indulgence of
ill-timed raillery or unpalatable rebuke, the King perceived that his
imprudent attachment surprized and shocked him: the prior’s florid
complexion changed frequently, and he spoke with a trepidation unusual
to him. Donna Gonsalva’s comparatively inferior birth, was in his
opinion an insurmountable objection; but<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_69">{69}</a></span> he forbore to press other
arguments upon his sovereign, whose suddenly inflamed looks warned him
to beware. Having by a strong effort conquered his excessive surprize,
which secret circumstances rendered almost insufferable, he gradually
acquiesced in the passionate reasoning of his kinsman, and began to
assist him with plans for the completion of these new wishes.</p>

<p>To facilitate the King’s interviews with Donna Gonsalva, and yet conceal
the affair from his court, it was requisite that some plausible excuse
should be found for his visiting Crato again: Antonio therefore offered
to return almost immediately to his priory, feign sickness there, and
intreat the society of his gracious cousin. This offer was accepted: Don
Antonio scarcely refreshed himself in Lisbon ere he set out once more
for Crato: the King remained behind, and for the first time in his life
gave audience to his ministers with a divided mind,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_70">{70}</a></span> after dispatching
the various state affairs for which he had returned to his capital, he
waited impatiently the prior’s summons, and shortly receiving it,
hastened, with a very small train, to the hunting lodge.</p>

<p>The interviews of the lovers were now regular, and every interview
heightened the young monarch’s passion. His fair mistress stimulated
this ardor by just as much condescension as excited without satisfying
hope; acquiring at each unexpected act of kindness fresh power over his
peace. Sebastian gradually lost that self-command upon which he piqued
himself, and often found that he bartered some of his independence for a
smile or a kiss: but he had learned the art of silencing his own
reproofs; and constantly declared to his cousin that he knew himself
beloved to excess, or he would not stoop to acts which otherwise would
be mean submissions.</p>

<p>At length, the moment so long panted<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_71">{71}</a></span> after, arrived; Gonsalva one
evening pronounced the tender confession of reciprocal preference, and
was rewarded the next instant by an avowal of her lover’s sovereign
rank.</p>

<p>Confused and agitated, the fair Portuguese half sunk upon her knee,
faltering out a few words of humility and gratitude: Sebastian hastened
to raise, and clasp her in his arms, while he explained his intention of
recalling her father from France in order to witness their immediate
marriage. Donna Gonsalva changed colour, averted her eyes, hesitated,
panted for breath, and at length apprehensively confessed that she was
under engagements to a young nobleman; nay, that her father had given
her to him in marriage at the age of seven years.</p>

<p>Had the earth opened at the feet of Sebastian, he could not have felt
more horror.&#8212;Speechless with emotion, his looks only continued to
interrogate Gonsalva: she trembled and wept, but conjured him<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_72">{72}</a></span> to
believe that after the ceremony was performed, she had almost forgotten
it, as her bridegroom had gone out to Goa with his grandfather the
viceroy of India, and was but lately returned.</p>

<p>“And you have seen him Gonsalva?” asked the King mournfully. “Yes, I
have seen him thrice, but without giving him the least hope that I would
ratify the cruel engagement in which my infant mind had no share.&#8212;When
he visited me last, you were absent, your love was doubtful, your real
rank unknown, I was uncertain whether you might ever return to me, and
yet I told him my resolution.”</p>

<p>“Then you loved me from the first?” cried the transported Sebastian,
“let not my Gonsalva ever again torture me with assumed indifference,
when this conduct shews that she preferred the pain of concealment to
the hazard of losing me by the early mention of this hateful obstacle.
Take courage, dearest! ties like these may<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_73">{73}</a></span> be broken without dishonour;
and thank God! I am a King.”</p>

<p>The impetuous and imperious Sebastian forgot at this moment his
character of <i>just</i>; he was incapable of admitting either a parent’s or
a husband’s right, when the one had used his power tyrannically, and the
other had been forced upon a child incapable of choice. To obtain the
pope’s bull for annulling this marriage, seemed not a matter of
difficulty; the consent of Vimiosa was of course certain; and as the
rival husband had not been long returned from India, he was not likely
to oppose the divorce from any motive of attachment: at all events,
Sebastian resolved to use his prerogative if necessary, since Gonsalva
had expressed for him the most passionate preference, and ought not her
happiness to be the first object of his life!&#8212;She now repeated her
promise of living for him alone, and at that sound the momentary
obstacle disappeared from her lover’s sight.</p>

<p>After this conference the rash young<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_74">{74}</a></span> monarch dispatched couriers into
France with letters to the count Vimiosa, demanding his daughter, and
inviting him to return and assist in dissolving the bands which tied her
to Don Emanuel de Castro: at the same time he sent a magnificent embassy
to Rome, praying for a divorce; and commissioned his cousin Antonio to
see and converse with Don Emanuel.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Donna Gonsalva had hinted to Sebastian the impropriety of
exposing her reputation to the scandal of being discovered in a
clandestine intercourse with her sovereign: having no longer a reason
for concealment, Sebastian embraced the permission this hint gave him,
and came with a splendid retinue to Vimiosa. His lords saw nothing
extraordinary in a young monarch paying a courteous visit to the sister
and daughter of one of his greatest subjects, but no sooner did they
behold the transcendent beauty of Donna Gonsalva, and the emotion of
their royal master,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_75">{75}</a></span> than a suspicion of the truth was awakened amongst
them.</p>

<p>Lost in a round of new and delightful enjoyments, Sebastian was from
that hour continually at the house of his mistress: his cousin
accompanied him in these visits, and warmly applauded his choice. But
the eloquence of the latter had been used in vain to obtain an hearing
from Don Emanuel De Castro; that young nobleman refusing to converse on
the subject of her marriage with any other than the King himself.</p>

<p>Sebastian’s nature was too generous not to revolt from some arbitrary
measures which Antonio suggested in the height of his zeal and
displeasure: he refused to degrade or distress his rival; and the
dictates of delicacy forbade him to attempt purchasing his acquiescence
by mere honours.</p>

<p>De Castro was indeed worthy of this liberal treatment: he had
distinguished himself in the Indies under his grandfa<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_76">{76}</a></span>ther, by the most
brilliant services. His intrepidity and genius for war were not the only
themes of praise; to these were added justice, temperance, a benevolent
attention to the natural propensities, habits, and even prejudices of
the Indians, and a conciliating manner which subdued them still more
than his arms. Filial piety was the first of his virtues: after twelve
years residence in India, a dangerous disease fastened upon his aged
parent, which compelled him to return home: Don Emanuel was advised to
remain at Goa, where he would in all probability receive an immediate
nomination to succeed the viceroy in his government; but he refused to
act thus:&#8212;abandoning this expectation, and resigning his military
command, he left the eastern world, chiefly for the sake of softening
the discomforts of a tedious voyage to a relation he revered; though the
idea of claiming his young bride sweetened the sacrifice.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_77">{77}</a></span></p>

<p>On reaching Portugal, the viceroy had gone to his seat at Santaren, from
whence Don Emanuel had twice visited Gonsalva: but the death of his
beloved grandfather quickly followed, and prevented him from seeing her
again, till the first days of his mourning were passed.&#8212;Don Emanuel was
preparing to appear at court for the first time, when the King’s
pleasure was intimated to him by the prior of Crato. Refusing to discuss
so important a matter with a third person, he was ordered into the
presence of his sovereign.&#8212;The King alone, and secretly at war with
himself, received him with embarrassment: his excessive emotion formed a
decided contrast to the grave and dignified composure of De Castro. The
latter was just going to pay the usual mark of homage to princes, when
Sebastian impetuously caught him by the arm, exclaiming, “Bend not your
knee to one who would dismiss from your mind in this conference all
thought of his authority: I wish you to hear me,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_78">{78}</a></span> Don Emanuel, not as a
King, who might insist, but as a man who is willing to submit to the
decision of equity.&#8212;In conversing on this interesting topic, let us
think only of the rights and the happiness of Donna Gonsalva&#8212;let us
forget, if possible, our own desires.&#8212;Believe me, if I did not flatter
myself with being inexpressibly dear to her, if I did not abhor and
renounce with my whole heart this unnatural practice of infant nuptials,
I would not seek to release her hand, though certain of commanding it
the next instant:&#8212;nay, had I known earlier of her engagements,
preposterous as I deem them, I would have avoided the scandal and the
pain of dissolving them.”</p>

<p>De Castro fixed his eyes upon the ingenuous though disturbed countenance
of the King: esteem and compassion were in the look.&#8212;“This is the first
time,” he said, “in which I have had the honour of seeing and conversing
with my sovereign, and I foresee it will add to my for<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_79">{79}</a></span>mer loyalty, the
sentiments of gratitude and admiration.&#8212;my fortunes, my services, my
life, sire, are at your feet, dispose of them henceforth as you will;
but I beseech you for your own honour and happiness, for the sake of
your people, proceed no further in dissolving my union with Donna
Gonsalva.”</p>

<p>“How! Don Emanuel,” exclaimed Sebastian, “do you pretend to persuade me
of these animated sentiments, and yet deny me the only favor peculiarly
your own to bestow? as your sovereign I may command your services and
life; but when I ask of you with the simplicity of an equal, to resign
the shadow of a right over a woman whom <i>you</i> cannot love, whom <i>I</i> love
with all the ardour of virtuous tenderness, and who blesses me in
return, when I ask <i>this</i> at your hands, you capriciously, tyrannically
deny me. What conduct is this? how dare you mock me with expressions of
devoted regard?<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_80">{80}</a></span>”</p>

<p>Embarrassed yet not confounded, Don Emanuel was silent; the king pressed
his remark with increased ardour, adding, in a tone of greater emotion,
“You were contracted to Donna Gonsalva at the age of thirteen, you went
immediately after to India, from whence you are returned but three
months; in that period you have seen the fair Gonsalva only thrice, and
that in reserved interviews before her aunt, where nothing beyond
personal graces could speak to your senses. No charm of varied
discourse; no enchantment of sensibility could penetrate to your soul;
the coldness of her feelings must have chilled yours: love feeds, grows,
lives upon love! Can you then, will you then have the injustice to place
your mere admiration of her beauty upon a par with my lively preference
of her character, and my tender sympathy with her disinterested
affection? Have a care, Don Emmanuel, force me not to resume the King;
you may rouse me into measures which otherwise I would have spurned.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_81">{81}</a></span>”</p>

<p>“I trust, Sire, to your own conviction of the justice of my claim,
replied De Castro firmly, the king of Portugal is born to be the glory
and the examplar of Kings: he will teach the Portuguese to obey the
laws, by first obeying them himself; he will respect even the simplest
rights of his subjects; he will reflect that absolute power tempts to
oppression, and renders self-denial the greatest effort of virtue; and
in proportion as injustice is easy to him, his magnanimity will render
it difficult.” Don Emanuel paused, but Sebastian was silent; for there
was something in Don Emanuel’s manner which at once inspired respect,
and rivetted attention: interpreting his sovereign’s looks, that
nobleman continued&#8212;“Pardon my boldness, sire, if I venture to tell you,
that in marrying a subject, and that subject a woman ravished from her
husband, you will stain your unsullied name, and disappoint your people.
Hitherto, monarchs of Portugal have<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_82">{82}</a></span> strengthened their power by foreign
alliances&#8212;you, sire, have refused daughters of France and Spain; and
when it is known that you have refused them for a private person, may we
not dread the consequences?”</p>

<p>“What! Don Emanuel,” interrupted Sebastian, “does your otherwise
admirable theory of a prince’s duties, lead to this extravagant
conclusion, that he is bound to sacrifice his domestic happiness to a
mere shew of benefitting his people?&#8212;Is a powerful alliance more than a
political pageant?&#8212;When did you ever find the dearest connections
amongst earthly potentates, (and I blush for them whilst I urge it,)
able to counterbalance the promptings of ambition and opportunity? every
solid advantage would be as firmly secured to Portugal by my union with
a subject as with a princess. I am not the first King of Portugal who
has declared that ‘marriage is the prerogative of every man.’<span class="lftspc">”</span></p>

<p>“True, Sire!” returned De Castro,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_83">{83}</a></span> respectfully, “but your majesty will
remember that the august monarch who made this declaration, coupled it
with these words&#8212;<i>I promise never to invade this prerogative in the
person of another, and for that reason expect never to have it invaded
in my own.</i>”</p>

<p>“De Castro,” said the King earnestly, “tell me that you tenderly,
exclusively love her&#8212;swear it to me by your hope of eternal salvation,
and whatever it may cost me, I will relinquish my own happiness, but
never again expect to behold the face of your sovereign: for the man who
would force to his arms an unwilling bride, must have a soul with which
mine can have no fellowship.”</p>

<p>Extremely affected by the honourable emotion of his royal master, Don
Emanuel’s voice faltered as he replied, “My nature, sire, is incapable
of deriving gratification from any forced submission; much less from
that submission of woman’s heart, which must be voluntary to be
sweet:&#8212;be assured Donna Gonsalva<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_84">{84}</a></span> shall not be compelled into my arms.
To swear I love her dearer than any thing on earth, would be false, for
I love my King better: I take Heaven to witness it is more for his honor
and prosperity, than for my own wishes, that I thus desperately risk his
displeasure. Time, perhaps, may plead in my justification, and convince
you, sire, that though I refuse every other ground of discussion except
that of right, yet am I sincere when I repeat, that for loyalty and the
most passionate wish for your majesty’s real happiness, my heart may
challenge any heart in Portugal.”</p>

<p>Sebastian’s indignant eyes searched the countenance of Don Emanuel;
“There is a proud mystery about you, sir,” he said, “which displeases
me:&#8212;I have humbled myself too much.&#8212;Since it is to be a question of
right, learn to respect the rights of your prince. From this hour know
that I will be obeyed.”</p>

<p>Don Emanuel threw himself at the King’s feet.&#8212;“Then I must <i>implore</i>
for<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_85">{85}</a></span> justice, and conjure my sovereign to decide on my claim as he would
have done in a similar cause in which he was not a party. Ah, sire! you
turn pale! your upright soul feels the force of that plain appeal. Would
to God, for your own august sake, that you would not precipitately do an
act of violence.&#8212;Have you no fears, sire, that the woman who could so
long conceal, and so lightly break a sacred tie (however imposed,) has
been actuated by less disinterested motives than those of virtuous
love?”</p>

<p>At this unexpected question, the King lost all command of his passions,
and fiercely motioned for Don Emanuel to withdraw; his look and gesture
were too violent not to warn de Castro that he trod on the brink of a
precipice: that young nobleman rose from the ground, and as he bowed
respectfully, a deep sigh escaped him, he bowed again, and left the King
to his own thoughts.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_86">{86}</a></span></p>

<h2><a id="CHAP_III"></a>CHAP. III.</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">Sebastian’s</span> mind was a tempest of angry feelings. It was now evident,
that unless the presence and arguments of the Count Vimiosa should
prevail over De Castro’s obstinacy, he must be forced to use compulsion:
such measures were so abhorrent to his nature that he felt increased
aversion for the man who thus rendered them necessary.</p>

<p>Don Emanuel was forbid to appear at court; yet his still generous,
though indignant sovereign, neither abridged his honours nor his
liberty: he testified his displeasure merely by banishing him from his
presence. The prior of Crato observed this moderation and blamed it:
Sebastian answered him by saying, “De Castro has to thank me for much
more forbearance: were I to follow the dictates of my proud<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_87">{87}</a></span> spirit, I
would crush him with benefits, and render this perseverance odious to
the whole world. But I disdain to take so unfair an advantage.” Antonio
was not reconciled to such a refinement of honour, yet he attempted not
to ridicule it. The arrival of the Count Vimiosa revived the spirits of
the King; from him he expected implicit submission, and he found it. The
Count had early learned the court lesson of obedience; and was besides
intoxicated with the height to which his daughter’s elevation would
raise himself: he professed his willingness to repair in person to Rome
for the dispensation; inveighing bitterly against the rash and selfish
man who thus ventured to contend with his prince.</p>

<p>Sebastian could not conceal from his own thoughts that he despised this
pliant father, who boasted acquiescence as the fruit of reverence to
royal authority, not as springing from the conviction of woman’s right
to dispose of her affection<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_88">{88}</a></span> and her hand: Sebastian was accustomed to
estimate the value of men’s actions by their motives; and scorning those
of Vimiosa, scarcely brooked his presence even in the society of his
daughter. However, for her sake he gave him the palace of Xabregas, to
which she was shortly after removed with her discreet aunt from the
vicinity of Crato.</p>

<p>Though debarred from personally appearing before the King, Don Emanuel
addressed a letter to him full of duteous affection, in which he offered
to forego all claim upon Donna Gonsalva, provided she continued to wish
it at the expiration of six months: but for that period he stipulated
that she must either retire into a convent, or accept the protection of
his aunt Donna Garcia di Nugnez, a lady of unblemished reputation, under
her roof she might receive his visits, and those of the King also.</p>

<p>This proposal De Castro pressed with such earnestness (offering to
pledge him<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_89">{89}</a></span>self under forfeiture of his estates and life, to use no
authority over the will of Donna Gonsalva,) that Sebastian was induced
to consider it&#8212;there was such an air of sincerity in the whole of that
young nobleman’s conduct, and his character had hitherto been so
irreproachable, that it was impossible even for the passion-blinded King
to refuse believing him innocent of wanton insolence. Whatever romantic
notions of right and honour might tempt him into the present opposition,
it was evident that he rather sought to give his prince time to
recollect himself, than finally to thwart his wishes.</p>

<p>Stimulated to convince Don Emanuel that his choice arose not from a
temporary gust of passion, Sebastian half-resolved to accept these
offered terms, and consent to six months probation. With this view he
hastened from the palace of Ribera to that of Xabregas, to communicate
the letter to Donna Gonsalva: he found her in the midst of her little
court, like the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_90">{90}</a></span> Queen of beauty surrounded by graces and loves. On his
entrance the nobles retired, leaving only the prior of Crato, and Donna
Sancha Vimiosa.</p>

<p>While the fair Portuguese read De Castro’s letter, the blood suddenly
forsook her lips and cheeks; she fixed her amazed eyes on Don Antonio,
as if unconscious of what they looked on, repeating aloud “for six
months!”&#8212;at that moment Sebastian forgot his rational resolution; “but
we are not to be debarred the society of each other all that time, my
Gonsalva!” said he, tenderly kissing her hand.</p>

<p>Gonsalva gazed at him with a mixture of astonishment and
apprehension&#8212;“already so indifferent!” she exclaimed&#8212;“artful De
Castro, thou knowest but too well, I fear, how those six months would
end!”</p>

<p>“Donna Gonsalva!” cried the prior, with no very respectful roughness,
“are you in your senses?&#8212;observe the king.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_91">{91}</a></span>”</p>

<p>Instantaneously recalled, the beautiful Gonsalva recovered from her
extraordinary agitation, and turning to her lover, beheld on his
countenance such an expression of grateful surprize and fond regret,
then she half sunk into his arms, repeating with the voice of a syren
“you will not banish me from happiness for six long months? you will not
kill your Gonsalva with fears which your authority may end for ever!”</p>

<p>Sebastian pressed her to him in a transport of love&#8212;“what is it you
fear!” he exclaimed, “what is it alarms my Gonsalva!”</p>

<p>His charming mistress cast down her eyes abashed, “I fear, without cause
perhaps,” she said, “yet, you have yourself often remarked, that true
tenderness trembles at every delay of what it sighs for.&#8212;These six
months passed with a relation of the man who calls himself my
husband&#8212;these six months in which you may be wrought on to abandon
me&#8212;are so fright<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_92">{92}</a></span>ful&#8212;so sad&#8212;alas! how shall I live through them!”</p>

<p>Antonio, who was reading the important letter, now broke in upon
Sebastian’s soothings: he spoke with peculiar warmth on the weakness of
allowing himself to be thus trifled with by an inferior. He could not
understand, he observed, any of those romantic notions which his royal
master urged in defence of Don Emanuel; but frankly gave it as his
opinion that De Castro, so far from being sincere in his promise of
resigning the lady in half a year, was more likely to take a base
advantage of a husband’s authority, and whenever Donna Gonsalva should
be removed from her own family, render it impossible for her to return
to her lover.</p>

<p>“I am not a deep reasoner, my honoured cousin,” added the prior, with
his usual good-humoured levity&#8212;“but depend on it I see actions as they
are; and never am out in men’s motives,&#8212;shall I tell you<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_93">{93}</a></span> what I would
do in your majesty’s place?&#8212;I would flatly refuse this insidious offer,
and send the proposer of it back to the Indies: give him the viceroyalty
by way of consolation.”</p>

<p>“Not to get him quietly out of the way:” replied the King, “do not
injure yourself so in my thoughts Antonio, by urging such unworthy
conduct!&#8212;no, he shall be heard at the tribunal to which I appeal. I am
not going to <i>rob</i> him.”</p>

<p>“Your majesty’s apprehension is so quick, and so erring sometimes!”
cried the smiling prior, “I simply meant him to be complimented with the
government of India, <i>after</i> the cause had gone against him.”</p>

<p>“No, nor that either,” answered Sebastian, “I will not purchase the
silence of an enemy at the expense of my people. If I am to believe De
Castro insincere and unworthy, he is not to be trusted with the
destinies of thousands.”</p>

<p>“Well, you must pardon my zeal, sire<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_94">{94}</a></span>!&#8212;I would perform a ten year’s
penance for your sake, (and your majesty knows how ill long fasts and
sleepless nights suit my taste,) and it chafes me into uncharitableness,
perhaps, to find a fellow cheating your generous nature with mere
breath.”</p>

<p>“I know your affectionate heart!” said the King, with one of his benign
smiles: then turning to Gonsalva, who had been all this time resting her
fair cheek on his shoulder, and moistening it with tears, he besought
her to pronounce her will, and it should be obeyed.</p>

<p>“Renew your solicitations at Rome!” she exclaimed, pleasure sparkling in
her eyes&#8212;“suffer me still to remain at Xabregas with my kind aunt
here&#8212;and from this hour till the blessed one which makes me yours,
refuse to see or hear from Don Emanuel.&#8212;Never, never again let me be
tortured with his presence.”</p>

<p>The King kissed her hand in token of assent; and De Castro’s proposal
was rejected.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_95">{95}</a></span></p>

<p>A second embassy was now dispatched under the Count Vimiosa into Italy;
while Don Emanuel, wearied with fruitless efforts to see the King again,
and secretly supported by many of the nobility, who envied the elevation
of the Vimiosas, went himself to Rome to ask for justice at the feet of
the pope. His cause was strengthened by the French court, exasperated at
the refusal of their alliance with Portugal; and strenuously promoted by
the influence of a high Italian family with whom he was connected by
blood.&#8212;But Sebastian felt secure of success, and intoxicated by the
delight of love, could not conceive the possibility of disappointment.</p>

<p>His beautiful idol was now the idol of the people and the nobles;
wherever she moved, crowds hung upon her charms; the graces of her air,
and the bewitching playfulness of her manner, attracted hearts as well
as eyes, and among the young lords who approached the fascination of<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_96">{96}</a></span>
her accomplishments, scarcely any one preserved himself from the torment
of fruitless desires.&#8212;This admiration from others, increased the
passion, because it flattered the pride of the King; and assured of
being exclusively beloved, he no longer blushed to display the excess
and tenderness of his feelings.</p>

<p>At length the pope’s decision arrived;&#8212;Count Vimiosa returned
triumphant; De Castro foiled.</p>

<p>Transported with joy, Sebastian flew to impart the tidings to Donna
Gonsalva: how was she struck on finding that her father had obtained her
lover’s suit, only by promising his holiness the performance of an
imprudent vow once made by the King to Don Antonio!&#8212;that vow would
leave her still without perfect security; it would take him into Africa,
amidst danger and death!</p>

<p>The most violent bursts of tears, shrieks, and fits, followed this
unhappy disclosure; Sebastian had never before seen her<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_97">{97}</a></span> so moved:
ravished with such convincing proofs of his empire over her heart, he
renewed his protestations of eternal fidelity, accompanying them with
many a fond endearment. By degrees his arguments and caresses produced
soothing effects, and the weeping beauty was pacified.&#8212;Nature indeed
had blessed her with a disposition so averse from thought and care, that
grief dwelt with her but an instant: she made her lover repeat all his
vows of love and truth, and the assurance of denying De Castro’s return
to court, and then she revived to smiling happiness.</p>

<p>The arrival of Vimiosa had been expected to prove the signal of De
Castro’s disgrace; but on the contrary the King simply announced the
continuance of his banishment from palace parties, while he
distinguished his former services by such honorary rewards as in those
days of high-pitched honour, were more dearly<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_98">{98}</a></span> prized and more eagerly
sought, than are the <i>substantial recompensings</i> of modern times.</p>

<p>Donna Gonsalva, soon after, blazing in jewels, and attended by a
splendid retinue of pages and ladies, received the compliments of the
nobility in the palace of Xabregas.&#8212;Everywhere announced as their
future queen, her favour was courted, her influence implored: it was no
longer Sebastian, but she who ruled in Portugal.</p>

<p>Don Emanuel de Castro shocked at this ascendancy, which it was in vain
for him to attempt opposing, retired to the house of a relation in a
remote province, where he passed his hours in study and benevolent acts:
his name ceased to be spoken of at court, and even his remembrance
shortly wore out of the minds of the courtiers.</p>

<p>Blended with the idea of happiness and Gonsalva, the enterprize against
Africa, had commenced. Sebastian’s roused spi<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_99">{99}</a></span>rit once more breathed war
and religious enthusiasm: he directed levies to be made, youth trained,
foreign powers solicited, and a crusade preached throughout his
dominions; he passed himself from province to province, ascertaining its
strength and proportioning its supplies to its ability: he stimulated
the exertions of his officers, by new distinctions, and solicitously
sought to obtain the aid of his uncle Philip II. who then ruled in
Spain. This was liberally promised him; shamefully withholden!</p>

<p>The prior of Crato, enflamed with the same ardour, and sanctioned by the
title of a religious war, accompanied his royal cousin in these
progresses, liberally offering his revenues and retainers to aid and
support the cause:&#8212;he was to make one in the formidable expedition; a
circumstance highly agreeable to the King, who loved his enlivening
talents, and was accustomed to talk with him of Gonsalva.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_100">{100}</a></span></p>

<p>But the glory of their little army consisted in one gallant stranger,
Sir Thomas Stukeley of England.&#8212;This brave adventurer had left his
native country from the restlessness of a disordered but fine mind, and
hearing of Sebastian’s intended attack upon the Moors, came to offer his
services at the head of a band of noble Italians.</p>

<p>The chivalric romance of Stukeley captivated our youthful hero; he found
in him that ardour of enterprize, and those unquenchable hopes, which he
had hitherto believed his own peculiar property. While they conversed
together, both burned with the same fire; prudential calculations were
equally despised by each; danger only, possessed charms for them, and
success, unless torn from the arms of destruction, was to them destitute
of honour.</p>

<p>Stukeley’s reason had once been rudely assaulted by a domestic calamity;
and though it still remained uninjured in the eyes of most men, deeper
observers beheld<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_101">{101}</a></span> a lamentable chasm in his once perfect mind:&#8212;an
exuberance of imagination had usurped the place of the reasoning
faculty; while his heart, true to its nature and to its habits, fed this
imagination with visions of exalted but often hazardous virtue.</p>

<p>The wild inspiration of his countenance, breathing goodness and
greatness, never suggested to Sebastian the idea of an unsettled
intellect: what might have appeared feverish ravings in another, were
sublimed by the magnificent eloquence of Stukeley into theories of
god-like excellence, and heroic exploit.&#8212;The young monarch listened to
these effusions till their magic transformed impossibilities into
certainties: hitherto his character impelled others; now, it was
impelled in its turn, and borne with resistless force before the mighty
character of Stukeley.</p>

<p>With such a coadjutor, the King of Portugal was enabled to give an
additional impulse to the martial spirit of his king<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_102">{102}</a></span>dom, Stukeley was a
zealous catholic like himself, and the destruction of the infidels was
equally the object of his wishes.</p>

<p>An opportunity of prosperously invading Africa, now presented itself.
One of the Moorish princes who had been dethroned by his uncle Muley
Moloch, King of Fez, Morocco, and Tarradunt, after vainly soliciting the
aid of Mahometan courts, came as a suppliant to Portugal: he pleaded his
rights and his distress; offering the monarch in lieu of assistance,
several valuable territories along the sea-coast.</p>

<p>Sebastian’s zeal for the extension of Christianity would not suffer him
to be contented with a mere accession of territory: he dictated new
terms; stipulating for the half of whatever was re-conquered, and for
the enlargement of every Christian found enslaved amongst the Moors. But
the leading article in their treaty was an agreement that no Christian<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_103">{103}</a></span>
hereafter should be forced into the profession of Mahometanism, and that
the Emperor of Morocco should make a law for this purpose, under the
penalty of death to any of his subjects who should disobey.</p>

<p>By this arrangement Sebastian insured to himself a substantial hold on
Africa; and though aware of the small probability there was that Muley
Hamet should fulfil the latter part of their treaty, he was now
conscious of possessing in this article, (if infringed) a justifiable
plea for turning his arms against so faithless an ally.</p>

<p>On completing this compact with the Moor, and receiving some mercenaries
from Germany and Flanders, the King called a general assembly of his
nobles and ministers.&#8212;After eloquently detailing his motives for taking
arms, and the advantages likely to result from it to all Christendom, he
proceeded to say, that he convened his council, not to ask their advice,
but to instruct them in his aim,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_104">{104}</a></span> and to receive their concurrence. He
called God to witness, that his first and dearest aim was the
preservation of unnumbered souls who now groaned under the sinful yoke
of a detestable religion, and perhaps wanted only to live under a
Christian government, and be taught by Christian teachers, to awake from
their delusion: he pathetically painted the miseries of his captive
countrymen to whom the Portuguese arms were about to give freedom: he
then commented on the political advantage of acquiring a maritime
frontier in Africa for the protection of their trade with the gold
coast; and lastly, he avowed a strong desire for honorable distinction.
His impetuous youth here dwelt delighted, and laid claim to some
indulgence for this last infirmity of noble minds: he finished an
animated confession of that infirmity, by these words from Cicero.</p>

<p>“Should we in the pursuits of virtue have any of its rewards in view,
the no<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_105">{105}</a></span>blest of all, is glory: this alone compensates the shortness of
life, by the immortality of fame; by this we are still present when
absent from the world, and survive even after death. By the steps of
glory, in short, mortals mount to heaven.”</p>

<p>This speech produced very different effects upon his hearers: the
younger were already converts to his opinion; but the old and
experienced, who had lived long enough in the world to foresee the
probable termination of this military romance, received their King’s
determination sorrowfully. Each, in private, endeavoured to persuade him
of the impracticability of subduing Africa with a handful of men,
unsupported by foreign succours, and depending for their safety in a
great measure on the good faith of an infidel ally: they expatiated upon
the exhaustless numbers of the Moors, and their knowledge of their own
country, where he, would fight upon ground he knew little of,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_106">{106}</a></span> where in
the event of a defeat he might be so bewildered as not to get back to
his transports, and must consequently resign his troops either to
starvation or captivity.</p>

<p>Similar arguments were pressed on him by the ambassadors of foreign
courts; but they served only to inflame the courage of Sebastian, and to
exasperate him against their masters, those cautious monarchs who proved
themselves nominal sons of the church, since they would not contribute
one detachment towards his enterprize. His uncle too, the Cardinal
Henry, opposed the expedition, and aided by the foreboding lamentations
of the Queen dowager, frequently agitated their rash kinsman by
unavailing remonstrances.</p>

<p>Sebastian listened respectfully to each; but, seduced into the belief of
being born for the destruction of Mahometanism, persevered in his
resolution.</p>

<p>To the enchantments of Donna Gon<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_107">{107}</a></span>salva he continually turned from these
vexations: her wit enlivened him, her syren voice soothed the most
turbulent emotions of his soul, and his unsated eyes found ceaseless
delight in following the graceful varieties of her face and figure: yet
Sebastian had a void in his heart; a something unfilled, unsatisfied,
which he placed to the account of the imperfection of human felicity.
Donna Gonsalva was exquisite in person and mind; she certainly loved
him, but her love did not meet either the delicacy or the intensity of
his: her feelings were obtuse in those trifles to which sensibility is
tremblingly alive: she would often pursue her own sprightly pleasures
with such eager forgetfulness of him, as to mortify and displease him.
Two or three times he had entered her apartments at Xabregas in the
bitterness of a spirit traversed and exhausted by political
disappointments, and she had not observed it: his watchful passion was
never one moment<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_108">{108}</a></span> insensible to the slightest variation of its object;
not even the mist of an unpleasant thought could shade that heaven of
beauty, without disturbing his repose&#8212;and she&#8212;yes she, often saw him
agitated or depressed, without observation.</p>

<p>It was at these periods that Sebastian acknowledged the torments and the
omnipotence of love: he saw a defect in his idol, yet he worshipped her
still.</p>

<p>But what could he desire more than to be loved with all the powers of
her soul? if that soul wanted some of the energy of his, was it not her
misfortune rather than her fault? his reason assented to this, though
his heart frequently burst out into fond complaints which Gonsalva
silenced by the warmest assurance of preference. Under the immediate
impression of his grief, she would lose no opportunity of evincing her
tenderness, and then Sebastian’s transports would return: but attentions
which do not flow spontaneously from a natural softness, seldom are
last<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_109">{109}</a></span>ing; Donna Gonsalva would soon forget her lover’s character,
because her own was of a lighter stamp, and gay thoughtlessness
uniformly succeeded a short solicitude.</p>

<p>This perpetual inconsideration deeply wounded the King; for a lover like
him, expected to throb in every pulse of her heart. Racked with repeated
mortifications, that perhaps owed their existence to an impassioned
fastidiousness “which I beseech ye, call a godly sin”&#8212;he looked
anxiously towards the hour of his departure from Portugal, secretly
hoping to endear himself by danger, or at least to rouse some of those
sensibilities which were as wholly concealed now by ceaseless gaiety, as
when no anxieties existed to call them forth.</p>

<p>Don Antonio was ever Gonsalva’s advocate; sometimes rallying, and
sometimes more seriously reproving his royal cousin for pampering a
sickly sensitiveness, which thus poisoned life’s chief blessing.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_110">{110}</a></span></p>

<p>Sir Thomas Stukely, ignorant of his illustrious friend’s discontent,
unconsciously increased it; for one night in a walk among the gardens of
Ribera, under the boundless and starry heavens, he poured into the
attentive ear of Sebastian, the story of his early life: that story,
though it might be comprised in a single incident, was deeply
interesting to the young King, whose heart, penetrated with one
affection, delighted to sympathize with every other; yet he listened
sadly, for he thought the more of Gonsalva’s temperate feelings.</p>

<p>The untimely death of a brother, long and justly beloved, had driven
Stukely a wanderer from his country: that brother’s character, made up
of every estimable and endearing quality; his fraternal love “exceeding
the love of women,” were depicted in the heart-wringing language of a
regret increasing with time.</p>

<p>“We lived in our native Devonshire,” continued Stukely, “far from the
excitements and the temptations of a court; ig<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_111">{111}</a></span>norant of any mortal
happiness beyond each others deserved encomiums. One fatal day, hunting
among the woods round Illfracombe&#8212;my erring spear&#8212;I cannot describe
it!&#8212;this brother, dearer to me than existence, this soul of my wretched
life, fell through a disastrous accident by my hand!&#8212;But he died with
forgiveness on his lips&#8212;he died kissing the hand that smote him!”&#8212;</p>

<p>Stukely’s voice assumed a fearful hollowness as he spoke the last words,
his eyes rolled back upon themselves, and his pale countenance expressed
the extremity of despair; but the next moment rapture illumined him, and
he wildly resumed&#8212;</p>

</div>

<p>Accustomed to hear his friend converse by snatches in a strain
resembling poetry, Sebastian made no remark on this momentary rhapsody:
Stukeley paused awhile, and then continued:</p>

<p>“After the loss of my brother, I know not what strange calamity fell on
me. I sometimes think I could not have been in my right mind. Memory
retains a confused notion of my having once formed a visionary project
of colonizing Florida, then but newly discovered, erecting over it the
sovereignty of an order still purer and more self-denying than the
orders of Jerusalem and Malta: I can recollect displeasing the young
queen Elizabeth with my romantic ambition. At length, when my intellect
recovered its cruel shock, I found myself in a court, filled with the
professors of a new religion; it was impossible for me to stay, even to
hear their doctrines. I passed from England to Ireland, from Ireland to
Italy, sorrowing and self-condemned for my involuntary crime; there, my
arms have<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_113">{113}</a></span> been constantly employed against the enemies of our holy
church. This wandering warfare; this renunciation of home, country, and
kindred, is the penance to which I have condemned myself: may it tend to
expiate my guilt!&#8212;My grief it cannot cure.” Again Stukeley mused
awhile, and again he abruptly added, “<span class="lftspc">’</span>Tis a distinguished privilege to
die in defence of the sacred cross! I swear never to abandon it! We will
plant the blessed banner on every mosque in Morocco, or perish in the
attempt.”</p>

<p>Gladly seizing the last subject suggested by Stukeley, Sebastian forbore
to comment on the melancholy commencement of their discourse, leading
him to talk of the meditated war, of which religion formed the only
basis.</p>

<p>Public affairs now hastened to a crisis: the armament was complete, and
the fleet equipped; the Pope had transmitted his blessing, with a
present exceeding in value that of the consecrated rose: it was an<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_114">{114}</a></span>
arrow which had pierced the side of St. Sebastian!</p>

<p>In their armour and field accoutrements, the nobility displayed infinite
splendour; and as desolated Portugal could not furnish many private
soldiers, the troops composed chiefly of gentlemen volunteers, seemed
but a gallant shew of accomplished knights.</p>

<p>The royal-standard (embroidered by Donna Gonsalva) was carried in
procession through the streets of Lisbon, to receive the benediction of
the archbishop; it was then delivered into the hand of the Marquis
Villa-real, and the army marshalled around it.</p>

<p>After this august ceremony, the troops prepared to embark, while his
officers and men were exchanging adieus with wives, sisters, and
parents, Sebastian hurried to take leave of Donna Gonsalva: she had for
some days yielded to an excess of grief, and had shut herself up from
all society. At sight of her royal lover clad<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_115">{115}</a></span> in the shining livery of
war, she flung herself into his arms with tears and cries; distracted at
the possibility of eventually losing him either by death or changed
sentiments, she wildly expressed a wish to become his by a secret, but
binding tie.</p>

<p>Sebastian pressed her to his breast in a tumult of tender delight,
“dearest treasure of my life!” he exclaimed, covering her fair brow with
kisses, “at this moment your Sebastian is blest to the utmost extent of
his fantastic desires.&#8212;Ah, Gonsalva! why have I ever believed you
indifferent, or incapable of exquisite love? be assured I go now,
confident of possessing your heart; I go to conquer for your sake, to
return worthy of you, covered with the spiritual dew of heaven, its
blessing and the blessings of millions:&#8212;but ask me not to forfeit my
right to this dear hand, by evading the conditions upon which it has
been awarded to me; I have promised our holy father to engage in an
expedition against the infidels<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_116">{116}</a></span>&#8212;successful or unsuccessful, I will
return to Portugal, and either share my glory with you, or&#8212;perish the
possibility of mischance!” Donna Gonsalva now redoubled her tears and
her endearments; and tying round his neck a picture of herself, conjured
him to remember that her existence was interwoven with his own.</p>

<p>As the enamoured King repeated his belief of her sincerity, he added
tenderly, “These tears, these sighs, my Gonsalva, can never be absent
from my thoughts: be assured that whenever you think of your Sebastian,
whether at the dead of night, or in the hurry of day, he is at that
moment thinking of you.”</p>

<p>His eyes overflowed as he spoke; he strained her to his bosom, held her
there an instant, then broke away. While moving towards the door, a
favourite dog that had always been his companion, leaped up, and licked
his forehead. “Farewel, Barémel!” said the softened king, “I cannot take
thee,&#8212;Stay with my Gonsal<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_117">{117}</a></span>va, and be cherished for thy master’s sake.”
On pronouncing these words, he gently pushed the faithful animal aside,
and hastened out of the apartment.</p>

<p>The royal equerries waited with their sovereign’s Arabian, at the gates
of Xabregas; Sebastian vaulted into his seat, and with a soul raised to
rapture by the undisguised fondness of Donna Gonsalva, rode towards the
place at which the troops were ordered to assemble.</p>

<p>There, the King and the soldier took their turn: he rode along the lines
formed by his army, proudly exulting in their strength and appearance.
His animation diffused cheerfulness through the soldiery; and a short
address, exhorting them to patience, perseverence, and fidelity, was
answered by loyal acclamations: the word was then given, and the army
began its march.</p>

<p>The figure of the young King, (clad in a suit of green armour) full of
youth, spirit, and hope, was picturesquely contrasted<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_118">{118}</a></span> by the wild
sadness of Stukeley, the light and shade of whose countenance at one
time flashed the fire of a warrior, at others was lost in a gloom of
unavailing regret. Don Antonio of Crato, formed a contrast of another
sort; his gold armour was gayly adorned with bosses and chasings, which
the priest’s vestment did not entirely conceal; his florid aspect seemed
equally free from thought and care: but there was one knight among the
troops whose face expressed many thoughts and many feelings: It was Don
Emanuel de Castro.</p>

<p>Without attempting to see or to address Sebastian, he had signified to
the master of the horse his intention of furnishing five hundred
harquebusiers for the expedition: through that nobleman’s interference
this offer was not only accepted, but he was permitted to head them
himself; and thus allowed an opportunity of retrieving his sovereign’s
lost favour. De Castro now rode among the noble volunteers, with a
serious brow.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_119">{119}</a></span></p>

<p>His steady judgment, neither hurried away by the romantic sanguineness
of the inexperienced Sebastian, nor actuated by that indifference to
life which left Stukeley without a wish to estimate danger, nor
constitutionally careless of every thing beyond present enjoyment, like
the prior of Crato, foresaw much to apprehend from the inadequacy of
their armament. A thousand gallant vessels, with their bravery of
tackling and of sails, made a noble shew in the bay; and twenty thousand
troops, in all the gloss of unstained arms, and unbroken spirits,
presented an imposing spectacle to the gaze of enthusiasts. But what
were these in reality, when contrasted with perhaps more than a hundred
thousand enemies upon their own ground? De Castro’s prophetic heart
ached in the midst of general exultation.</p>

<p>The various regiments were now embarking: as they marched along the
shore the sun flamed upon their banners and<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_120">{120}</a></span> coats of mail; the
inspiring trumpet resounded from all the neighbouring echoes; pealing
bells rung joyously from the city; and at intervals the discharge of
ordnance from adjacent forts, was seen to shake the ships and the hills.</p>

<p>Impatient to be the first embarked, Sebastian rode eagerly through his
people, amid their shouts and blessings, as if returning in triumph; his
youth, his personal graces, and the imposing dignity of his cause, made
every heart follow him. As he leaped into the boat which was to bear him
to the royal galley, he uncovered his head, and waving aloft his flowing
helmet, seemed to be commending Portugal to the protection of Heaven. By
his side stood his favourite page, and the Duke of Barcelos, two young
sons of the Duchess of Braganza, his near kinswoman, and next heir to
the crown: their tender childhood and gallant mien, their sweet faces,
yet wet with a mother’s tears, caused a momentary pang in the
multi<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_121">{121}</a></span>tude, but the sunny look of the King brightened regret into
exultation, and loud acclamations pursued the track of his departing
boat.</p>

<p>In a few hours more, the whole army was embarked, and then the fleet
weighing anchor, sailed out of the Tagus. Prosperous winds swelled their
sails to Cadiz, where they waited awhile for the promised succours from
Philip II. the Duke of Medina Sidonia feasted the King and the knights
there, with a munificence little inferior to royalty. After a week’s
delay the expected supplies arrived; they consisted but of two thousand
foot soldiers: the enraged Sebastian would have sent them back to his
dissembling uncle, had not the Duke of Medina found some plausible
excuse for his master’s conduct, and faithfully promised further aid in
his name.</p>

<p>Quickly irritated, and as easily appeased, the ingenuous monarch
believed this hollow apology, and returning the cour<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_122">{122}</a></span>teous entertainment
of his host by conferring on him an order of knighthood, re-embarked
with his army for the shores of Africa.</p>

<p>The Portuguese fleet crossed the mouth of the streights, and passing
within sight of Cape Spartel, coasted along as far as Tangier, where
Sebastian, with his English friend Stukeley, were landed, and the
remaining troops under Diego de Souza, and Antonio of Crato, proceeded
to the fortress of Arzile.</p>

<p>The Moorish princes Muley Hamet and his brother-in-law, Cid Albequerin,
were at Tangier, with a few armed followers, to receive the king of
Portugal: they delivered into his hands hostages for their fidelity,
conjuring their Christian ally not to listen to the deceptive
representations of the Xeriff Muley Moloch, whose ambassador was now
arrived at the fortress. Sebastian re-assured them, though he could not
refuse the Moorish envoy, an audience.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_123">{123}</a></span></p>

<p>On being admitted to the royal presence, the African delivered a letter
from his master, wherein moderation and spirit were admirably blended.
This letter declared the Xeriff prepared in all points for war, and
ready to meet it; but while he made such a declaration, he besought Don
Sebastian to weigh well the value of men’s lives ere he rashly threw
away his own and those of his subjects: he described with terrible
simplicity the immensity of his resources, and the number of his armies,
proving the improbability of success, though the Portuguese King were at
the head of 20,000 heroes. Having exhorted him to spare to his people
those virtues of his, that were yet only in the bud of blooming youth,
he entered into a full discussion of his own pretensions and those of
Hamet; by this discussion he laboured to shew that his right to the
crowns of Fez and Morocco, was superior to that of his nephew; and that
even were it otherwise, the latter had forfeited his<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_124">{124}</a></span> claim by acts of
cruelty and oppression. To secure peace, and the friendship of the
christians, he offered Don Sebastian undisturbed possession of every
fortress in Africa that ever had belonged or did now belong to Portugal,
and he promised to add to each of them, a moderate tract of arable land.</p>

<p>After pressing this proposal upon the young monarch, he once more
conjured him to weigh well the real interest of his subjects; concluding
with a sentiment memorable in a despotic prince.</p>

<p>“You know, great prince, (or ought to know) that the regal power
allotted us, makes us common servants of our creator; then of those
people whom we govern; so that observing the duties we owe to God, we
deliver blessings to mankind: in providing for the public good of our
states we magnify the honour of God; like the celestial bodies, which,
though they have much veneration, yet serve only to the benefit of the
world. It is the excellen<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_125">{125}</a></span>cy of our office to be the instruments whereby
happiness is delivered to nations.”</p>

<p>Negociation upon a proposal of this kind, so inadequate to the grand
object of Sebastian, was not likely to meet with his concurrence: he
bade the embassador bear his refusal to Muley Moloch, with an expression
of regret that such noble sentiments were not the production of a lawful
and a christian ruler. He then dismissed the ambassador, and went with
Sir Thomas Stukeley to examine the state of the fortress.</p>

<p>Stukeley was now become as dear, as he had ever appeared admirable, to
this warm-hearted sovereign: in the close intimacy and domestic habits
of a sea-voyage, the amiable parts of the Englishman’s character
gradually disclosed themselves; and their tastes and principles proving
consonant, the partiality of Sebastian increased so much, as to lead him
into a disclosure, which had more of friendship<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_126">{126}</a></span> than of justice in it.
This respected the disposal of Barbary.</p>

<p>Every one presumed that in the event of a conquest, Sebastian would
yield the empire of Morocco to Muley Hamet, and be himself crowned king
of Fez: but he had long resolved to prove the disinterestedness of his
motives, by awarding the throne of Fez to him who should most
distinguish himself in the expedition. To rescue the Moors from
ignorance and infidelity, by giving them a christian monarch and
christian teachers, was the chief aim of his enterprise: unsullied
honour was the only wreath he sought to preserve for his own brow.</p>

<p>By entrusting the secret to Stukeley, Sebastian unconsciously meant to
give additional energy to his friend’s arms, and to secure for him the
new monarchy: our gallant countryman received this information with
grateful enthusiasm; but unwilling to take an unfair advantage of his
competitors, besought the king to commu<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_127">{127}</a></span>nicate it to all his nobles,
when they should join the grand army.</p>

<p>Such generous conduct increased Sebastian’s esteem; he freely granted
the request, adding&#8212;“They will all have my good wishes for their
success, but you, Stukeley, will have my prayers.”</p>

<p>Orders were now issued for the Moorish forces under Muley Hamet, and the
Portuguese who had disembarked at Tangier with their king, to be ready
for marching to Arzile: there, the whole strength of their little army
was concentrated.</p>

<p>A tedious march along a hot and arid coast, produced sickness among the
soldiery; when they reached the main body, under Don Diego de Souza,
they found it somewhat enfeebled through the same cause: but a spirit of
enterprize still animated every breast; and as the immediate siege of
Larache was determined upon, a military council was called for the
purpose of ascertaining whether it were most<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_128">{128}</a></span> advisable to proceed
directly by land, through an enemy’s country, to the destined siege, or
to re-embark and proceed thither by sea.</p>

<p>At this suggestion of prudence, the rash monarch took fire: he had not
yet learned to separate true valour from that vain contempt of danger
which makes a man put his life to the hazard for an inadequate object,
or for the attainment of a good, attainable by less perilous means: he
vehemently protested against the latter measure, and his experienced
commanders were silenced without being convinced.</p>

<p>During the king’s stay at Tangier, his officers at Arzile had had time
to learn the exact strength of the enemy, and what dependence was to be
placed on the succours so largely promised by Hamet. Don Emanuel de
Castro now ventured in council to address his sovereign, informing him
that their Moorish ally had grossly exaggerated his ability and the
inclina<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_129">{129}</a></span>tions of the Africans, as they appeared mostly unanimous in
defence of the present Xeriff’s authority. That intrepid old man, he
said, was now sick of a fever, but was yet rapidly approaching at the
head of a hundred thousand men; fresh armies were forming in the rear
and flank of the christians; and should these succeed in turning their
other wing, (which they might easily do, if the Portuguese were marched
inland towards Larache,) so surrounded and cut off from their fleet,
destruction must follow. He therefore suggested the propriety of extreme
caution. At this remark the king frowned, and issued decisive orders for
proceeding to the river Lucos, (upon which stood the fortress) and
fording it, though in the mouth of the enemy’s cannon.</p>

<p>“If we begin to think of defeat, or of providing for our own security,”
he said sternly, to De Castro, “we are lost!&#8212;we have nothing to oppose
to this ocean of Moors that you talk of, but the belief that<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_130">{130}</a></span> we are
invincible.&#8212;Give us only the <i>enthusiasm</i> of our ancestors, and the
glorious field of Ourique will no longer stand unrivalled in the
imperishable page of history.”</p>

<p>De Castro granted the justice of this reliance upon the omnipotence of
opinion; yet a lurking suspicion of the Moorish Prince Hamet, made him
foresee ultimate disappointment: he pointed out several traits in the
infidel’s conduct, which indicated jealousy of the Christians, and
Sebastian admitting their force, promised to observe him narrowly.</p>

<p>The army now began its march towards Larache, and halted between Arzile
and Alcazar-quiver.&#8212;To proceed without a decisive engagement, was
become impossible; for the Xeriff’s force, consisting of sixty thousand
horse and forty thousand foot, had advanced by forced marches from
Morocco into Fez, secured the passage of the Lucos, and suddenly shewn
themselves, encamped in the plains of<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_131">{131}</a></span> Alcazar.&#8212;Don Sebastian was for
immediately advancing to give them battle; but against this step Muley
Hamet opposed many plausible arguments: he proposed that the Portuguese
should draw nearer to the coast, where, in case of extremity, they might
be received into their ships; by throwing up entrenchments, they could
there bid defiance to any assault, and would be secured from every
species of want, by supplies of ammunition and provisions from the
fleet.</p>

<p>“And for what is this delay proposed, now?”&#8212;cried the astonished
Sebastian, “are we to abandon our enterprize even on the threshold? are
we to shrink from the very difficulties we have courted, and fly before
an enemy with whom we have not exchanged a single blow? do you think we
came only to <i>look</i> at your countrymen?&#8212;In the name of God, prince,
what coward’s counsel is this?”</p>

<p>Dissembling his rage at the indiscreet anger of the young King, Hamet
coolly<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_132">{132}</a></span> replied, that Muley Moloch was now master of all the fords and
passages of the Lucos, from the ocean to the mountains of Benzeroel,
that consequently an attempt to force these would be the attempt of
madmen, since their troops were already fainting with a long sultry
march, and nearly destitute of provisions: by avoiding an engagement for
at least some days, they would give time for the arrival of King
Philip’s promised succours, and might be further re-inforced by
deserters from the usurper Moloch.</p>

<p>Perceiving his aim at last, and transported out of all patience, the
unreflecting Sebastian forgot every thing but indignation: he started
from his seat with a look of fierce defiance, crying out, “away with
such dissembling! Moor, I can read your heart:&#8212;you would do without the
aid of the Christians. In a few days, perhaps hours, you expect death to
rid you of your uncle, and give you these <span class="pagenum"><a id="page_133">{133}</a></span>kingdoms by some political
trick&#8212;then would our treaty, aye and our safety, be left to your
honour!&#8212;but thank heaven, my brave Portuguese are not to be thus
trifled with!&#8212;we shall march forward; if without you, for
ourselves,&#8212;for the release of christian captives&#8212;for the sake of the
blessed cross; if with you, for your advantage as well as for our
own,&#8212;and with a conscientious resolution to preserve <i>our</i> share in the
compact inviolate.</p>

<p>“Prince! we are in sight of the enemy&#8212;behold me draw this sword, which
I swear by the virgin mother of Jesus, never to sheathe till it has cut
my way through yonder host!”</p>

<p>A sublime sterness sat on the brow of the young warrior while he spoke:
in one moment the clashing of swords and the murmur of vows were heard
throughout the assembly; as if electrified with the same fire, all the
knights followed his chivalric example.</p>

<p>Hamet was silent: at length he bowed<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_134">{134}</a></span> before the royal seat, saying in a
subdued voice, “light of thy people, thou hast not interpreted my
zealous caution with the usual charity of a Christian: let my actions
speak for me!&#8212;I will follow thee unto death.”</p>

<p>“Prove that I have wronged thee, Hamet!” returned Sebastian, with a
relenting smile, “and thou shalt find me more prompt to repair, than I
have been to commit, this injury.”</p>

<p>Muley Hamet bowed submissively again; the clouds of passion and
suspicion then fled from the face of the King, and demanding his
officer’s attention, he proceeded to hear their separate opinions upon
the subject under discussion.</p>

<p>Experienced and inexperienced, now decided on Sebastian’s side; even De
Castro voted for giving battle to the Xeriff. Conduct that would have
been prudent at Arzile, became cowardice at Alcazar: to begin retreating
towards the coast, seemed at this period more hazard<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_135">{135}</a></span>ous than to risk an
engagement; for in the former case, an enormous army hanging upon their
rear, might harrass their retreat, and at last make an easy prey of the
famished and fatigued soldiers: by the former plan the Portuguese would
preserve a chance of victory, or at least secure to themselves
honourable graves.</p>

<p>Gratified with his council, and pleasingly surprised to find Don Emanuel
urgent for action, Sebastian graciously acknowledged that pleasure, and
paying a just tribute to his rival’s warlike talents, resolved
thenceforth only to remember his services.&#8212;He now gave him his hand
with a look so effulgently expressive, that De Castro’s tranquil
countenance became agitated with unexpected pleasure; he bent his knee
to the ground, and ventured to put his lips respectfully to the hand
that had been given him;&#8212;Sebastian suffered it to remain awhile in his
grasp&#8212;then calling his knights to their posts,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_136">{136}</a></span> hastened out to
reconnoitre and to marshal his troops.</p>

<p>All was now animation in the Portuguese camp; dauntless hearts, hot with
religious zeal, made them eager for engagement: the King went at night
from tent to tent, encouraging his men, and rousing their emulation by
proclaiming his intention of instituting a new order upon that day,
should Heaven bless his arms: to the highest distinction in this novel
institution, even the humblest soldier might aspire, and be enrolled in
the same proud list with his commander. From the private’s quarters he
returned to his own tent, where assembling his officers, he imparted the
magnificent prize destined for <i>their</i> reward:&#8212;the crown of Fez!</p>

<p>How does the outward lustre of a crown dazzle all eyes, and blind them
to its thorny lining! ambition, more potent even than love, sees no
defect in its object, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_137">{137}</a></span> grasps at it with the avidity of a soul
certain of seizing beautitude!&#8212;The nobles round King Sebastian looked
at each other for awhile without speaking; then actuated by the same
spirit, cast themselves at his feet in a transport of gratitude; their
tumultuous and lavish protestations infused confidence into their
sovereign, whose breast beat with the certainty of success: dismissing
them soon after, he threw himself upon his palliass, for a few hours
repose.</p>

<p>To sleep was impossible: Sebastian counted the night watches with
impatience, and just as morning broke, had the mortification to hear
rain falling heavily upon the roof of his tent: he leaped up, and
hurried into the air.&#8212;The dawn was now beginning to glimmer over the
extensive camp of the enemy, but the sky was moist and dark: to commence
an attack under such circumstances would be fruitless; the showers blew
directly in the face of his army, and would render their can<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_138">{138}</a></span>non and
harquebusses, almost useless;&#8212;he was therefore forced to command a
suspension of his orders.</p>

<p>After two hours of incessant rain, the clouds dispersed, and the sun
shone out with intense heat:&#8212;the King then hastily roused his page
(Diego of Braganza,) whose childish hands trembled while they clasped
the rivets of his master’s vantbrace.</p>

<p>“What! you tremble my little cousin?”&#8212;said he, stroaking his fair hair,
and smiling more tenderly than sportively.</p>

<p>“With impatience, Sire, not fear.”&#8212;replied the blushing boy.&#8212;Sebastian
gave him a hasty embrace; “thou hast the soul of a soldier!” he cried,
“if I fall to-day, may thy race sit on the throne of Portugal.”</p>

<p>“I would rather see a son of your majesty’s seated there:” answered the
intrepid child&#8212;“it is not my ambition to be a King; but I wish to make
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_139">{139}</a></span>myself greater than an ordinary King:&#8212;&#8212;I would willingly <i>live
worthily, and die nobly</i>!”</p>

<p>“Thou wilt do both, then, my brave cousin!” exclaimed Sebastian, “brief
or lengthened, thy career will be glorious, for that sentiment contains
a life of magnanimity.”</p>

<p>They were now issuing from the tent: Don Diego ventured to remark his
King’s imprudence in wearing armour of a colour, which being held almost
sacred by the Mahometans, would sharpen their resentment, and enable
them to take a surer note of his person. “I chose it for that very
purpose;” replied the monarch, “not to insult them, indeed, but to be
easier distinguished by friend and foe.&#8212;besides, Diego, green is the
colour of hope.”</p>

<p>Sebastian now left his tent, and put his troops in motion. If the genius
of Portugal could be supposed to have beheld them from the heights of
Benzeroel, tears such as immortals shed, might have flow<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_140">{140}</a></span>ed from her
eyes: the flower of her nobles and of her peasantry, were now gaily
marching to certain death.</p>

<p>For the first time since the foundation of their monarchy, the private
soldiers were stimulated by the prospect of chivalric honour, and their
leaders by the chance of a crown:&#8212;following their royal general both as
their King and their benefactor, the glow of virtuous emulation was on
every cheek, and in every heart.</p>

<p>The army, drawn up in three lines, now halted on the plain of Alcazar:
De Castro and Stukeley had the glory of leading the vanguard, which
consisted wholly of volunteers; the Portuguese infantry were in the
center, and the rear under Don Diego De Souza; on the right wing were
the Moorish horse of Muley Hamet, and the squadrons of count Vimiosa; on
the left were the royal standard, the banner of the cross, and the
flower of the Portuguese cavalry; round these, were seen the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_141">{141}</a></span> young
dukes of Barcelos, Contiuho, and D’Aveyro, the counts Villa-real,
Ridondo, and Norogno, the bishops of Coimbra and Porto, and lastly, the
prior of Crato.</p>

<p>Attended by his favorite page, the King was seen with his beaver up,
mounted on a white Arabian, riding along the lines, and animating his
men to the charge. His emerald-green armour, (on which the sun now
sparkled) and the white plume of his helmet, (now lifted by rising
winds) rendered him fatally conspicuous.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Moors were steadily advancing, with all the pomp of gaudy
banners and magnificent attire: in the midst of a chosen band was seen
the litter of their sick, but intrepid Xeriff.</p>

<p>A hundred thousand armed men, approaching in the form of a crescent,
gradually extending their wings to outstretch and inclose a handful of
Christians, made a formidable appearance: momentarily checking his
horse, Sebastian looked at them with some portion of that awe which<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_142">{142}</a></span> a
vast and powerful object excites, but without one throb of apprehension,
he believed himself under the immediate protection of an approving
Providence!</p>

<p>Suddenly the Moorish music began to play, and their troops advanced with
a quicker step: the king of Portugal rode to the left of his little
band, and placing himself before the royal-standard, bade his lords
remember that they fought for a crown. “I, for a heavenly one, and for
Gonsalva!” he whispered to himself, hastily darting his eye athwart the
mingled banners of the cross, and of Portugal.</p>

<p>The two armies were now so near each other, that the Portuguese could
distinctly see the Xeriff assisted from his litter to a horse; age and
sickness had enfeebled his body, but his energetic soul was yet
unimpaired. In the act of haranguing his men, he appeared slowly riding
through the lines, with flowing robes, and a long white beard, which
gave him a majestic air: Sebastian pitied his infirmi<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_143">{143}</a></span>ties, and beheld
his grey locks with reverence; he commanded his followers to spare, and
to respect Muley Moloch, should he fall into their hands, and then he
gave the signal for battle.</p>

<p>A general discharge of artillery began the action: the Portuguese horse
charged with impetuosity, their young King, like a destroying angel,
leading them on: his terrible looks, and still more terrible arm,
scattered the infidels on every side. Stukeley and De Castro’s track
resembled the path of lightning; for by the blue gloom of their steely
armour they were distinguished afar off, flaming through the dark ranks
of the enemy.</p>

<p>The Moors assaulted with all the fury of religious hate, and all the
fire of chivalry, gave way in every direction; their nobles fell in
heaps under the arrows, the swords, and the artillery, of the
christians: frantic with despair, Muley Moloch exerted the remaining
spark of life in an attempt to rally them; he spurred his<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_144">{144}</a></span> horse, and
brandishing a massy scymitar, aimed a blow at Don Antonio of Crato: that
effort was his last; he fell dead upon the field.</p>

<p>His body-guard with difficulty rescued their master’s corpse from the
Portuguese, and conveyed it to the litter, where his death was concealed
from the army; but the hoisting of a particular pendent over the litter,
by one of his ministers, who had secretly corresponded with the Xeriff
Hamet, gave the signal so long waited for by that perfidious wretch. He
had hitherto hung back in the action; now, he ordered his troops to turn
their arms upon their allies.</p>

<p>At this command, the left wing of the Moorish horse wheeled round, and
took the Christians in flank; a dreadful carnage ensued: the brave
Portuguese amazed, bewildered, not knowing who were or were not their
enemies, fought in darkness; even their German and Castillian
auxiliaries shared the fate of the treacher<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_145">{145}</a></span>ous infidels, for they now
dealt the strokes of death without discrimination: the presence of their
king all hacked and bleeding, only increased their consternation.</p>

<p>At this critical juncture, Stukeley appeared; waving his fiery sword as
a call for them to rally, and aim at conquest still, he broke through
the squadrons of Muley Hamet, like some tremendous comet that traverses
the wilds of æther, scattering terror and dismay over nations. He rushed
towards the traitor: Hamet read destruction in the deadly eyes of the
Englishman, and took to flight; Stukeley followed; his indignant threats
sounded through the field: gaining upon the Xeriff, he was aiming a
mortal blow at him, when the affrighted wretch threw himself into a
rivulet which crossed their path, and borne down by the weight of his
robes and armour, perished ingloriously. Stukeley looked at him for a
moment with scornful disappointment, then turned towards the fight.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_146">{146}</a></span></p>

<p>But he was now surrounded by a host of assailants: their merciless
weapons fell on his head, his shoulders, his limbs; he turned from side
to side, alternately parrying and receiving wounds. Fighting his way to
a ruined watch tower, he placed his back against it, and defended
himself with determined intrepidity; till at length, bleeding at every
pore, and exhausted with exertion, his resistance became fainter and
fainter. He staggered and sunk down. The dying hero cast his eyes around
as if in search of his friend, the next moment they closed for ever.
Thus fell the gallant Sir Thomas Stukeley, in the bloom of manhood, in a
foreign land!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Don Sebastian was attempting to regain the advantage of the
day: a short contest convinced him that it was no longer for victory,
but for safety, they must fight; of all his troops, there remained only
a remnant, but he bravely resolved rather to die than to desert them.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_147">{147}</a></span></p>

<p>Antonio, and the dukes of Barcelos and Aveyro, were taken prisoners; De
Castro was sinking under many wounds: the King himself was disabled in
one shoulder by a musquet shot, and was besides smarting with
sword-cuts: two horses had already been killed under him, and after
fighting some time on foot, one of his officers had now mounted him upon
a third.</p>

<p>Again, he charged the enemy with a few gallant troops; again his
powerful arm scattered the Moors like dust before a mighty wind.
Streaming with blood, De Castro followed his glorious path. That
faithful Noble (who had appeared throughout the whole of the battle, to
think only of his sovereign’s honour, his sovereign’s safety) now
interposed his body between him and destruction: the battle-axe of an
infidel was raised to fall on the unarmed head of Sebastian, when Don
Emanuel rushed forward, and sprung on the Moor; dashing down his lifted<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_148">{148}</a></span>
weapon, he grasped his body and grappled with him till they both fell:
Sebastian threw himself off his horse, and valiantly defended him; but
the Moors pouring in at every side, like so many torrents, forcibly
swept the brave friends asunder, and De Castro was taken.</p>

<p>The fight now turned into a slaughter: the Germans and Castillians were
all cut in pieces, the knights and nobles lay in heaps over the plain,
and among the vast army of Moors, but a solitary Portuguese was here and
there to be seen vainly combatting for life.</p>

<p>Retreating towards the river, (allured by a distant figure like Sir
Thomas Stukeley’s) Sebastian met his standard-bearer with the colours
wrapped round his body; animated with the remembrance of Donna Gonsalva,
the King exclaimed, “Brave Brito! let us die upon these.”</p>

<p>Scarcely had he spoken, when a body of infidels rushed tumultuously
towards them; Sebastian fought with the despe<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_149">{149}</a></span>ration of love; De Brito
and the colours were taken and re-taken repeatedly; but alas! the
strength of the former, was exhausted, and his single arm could no
longer encircle a faithful servant with protection. De Brito more
solicitous to save his king than to obey him, contested at last but
faintly, and suffered himself to be surrounded.</p>

<p>The Moors, clamourous in disputing the honour of having gained the
royal-standard, hurried off their prisoner, regardless of a solitary
individual covered with dust and blood, evidently on the point of
sinking amongst the slain.</p>

<p>Fortunately for Sebastian, these accidental circumstances, together with
the loss of his coronetted helmet and his horse, concealed him from
suspicion: he remained standing where they had left him, supporting
himself with difficulty upon the fragment of his sword. His strength now
ebbed apace: the blood pouring from a large cut on his head,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_150">{150}</a></span> and oozing
through the scarf with which his arm was bound, sickened and enfeebled
him; his very thoughts partook of the mortal languor creeping over all
his senses: a confusion of images, of Gonsalva, of Stukeley, of his page
Diego, swam through his brain; he staggered a few paces, fell, and
breathed no more!<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_151">{151}</a></span></p>

<h2><a id="CHAP_IV"></a>CHAP. IV.</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">After</span> the battle of Alcazar, there remained but fifty of the Portuguese
troops alive in Africa: most of these were prisoners to the Moors, and
the remainder gaining with difficulty the christian fortresses, at
length escaped homewards. The Moors in return lost above one-fifth of
their gigantic army, but the pillage of the christian camp, (filled with
all the riches of the East and West,) amply atoned, in their opinion,
for such a loss.</p>

<p>This memorable battle lasted from morning till long after mid-day, and
the sacking of the field of fight, continued till the next morning’s
dawn.</p>

<p>While the infidels were thus employed, a benevolent dervise, whose piety
was his authority and his protection, came to seek<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_152">{152}</a></span> for such christians
as might yet remain capable of receiving assistance: on the bank of the
Lucos, among a heap of tall Lentiscos, he caught a gleam of light as if
the moon-beams fell upon arms: the dervise stooped, and pushing away the
shrubs, applied his lanthorn to the object. It was the figure of a young
man, in armour, which bore marks of heavy and repeated blows; over his
forehead curled a profusion of hair steeped in blood; the white and
polished brow was trenched with a gaping wound, and the countenance
lovely in death, was yet embellished by a look of youthful sweetness,
which melted the good Mahometan’s heart; he knelt by the body, and
gently raising it, dropped balsam upon the wounds; he then poured a
cordial into the lips.</p>

<p>Presently he thought the brows were contracted with returning sensation:
animated by this, he cautiously unfastened the knight’s cuirass, and
opened the silk shirt beneath it; under this he saw the picture<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_153">{153}</a></span> of a
woman, which carefully putting aside, he exclaimed, “alas! poor youth,
here is one, doubtless, that will sorely lament thee!” As he spoke he
gently rubbed an aromatic liquid upon the Christian’s chest; the
experiment succeeded; by degrees the motion of the heart was
apparent&#8212;it increased&#8212;the body began to glow&#8212;and at last the stranger
visibly breathed.</p>

<p>Many minutes elapsed ere the benevolent mussulman saw the object of his
anxiety unclose his eyes; when he did so, he knew not that in succouring
a desolate stranger, he was bringing back to life the king of Portugal,
that foe to Mahomet.</p>

<p>Sebastian felt as if in a dream, but the last feeling to which he had
been conscious when he fell, was now the first he was sensible of: he
thought himself still pressing towards the river in search of Stukeley,
and impressed with that idea, uttered his name, and made an effort to
rise. Too feeble for exertion of any kind, he fell back upon the breast
of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_154">{154}</a></span> dervise, who in bad Portuguese assured him that he was in
safety.</p>

<p>The unfortunate monarch bowed his head with a mournful smile of bitter
recollection, without speaking. Meanwhile a servant attending the
dervise, formed a litter of oak-branches, covering it with some of these
soft, high grasses, which grow abundantly throughout Barbary, and
placing Sebastian upon it, assisted his master in bearing him to their
dwelling.</p>

<p>This was a retired cave formed by nature’s hand in a rock almost wholly
overgrown with flowering shrubs; the entrance was shaded by lofty
sycamores, and above it was heard the cooling sound of waters issuing
from numerous springs.</p>

<p>Tranquillity, the tranquillity of perfect solitude, surrounded this
habitation; Sebastian found himself conveyed through one rocky
apartment, into an interior cell where he was laid upon a mattrass, and
having some weak cordial given to him,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_155">{155}</a></span> left to repose: his enfeebled
powers overcome with this simple nourishment, soon sunk into the blessed
oblivion of sleep.</p>

<p>The dervise now and then came to watch his slumbers, but staid not to
disturb them: whenever his patient awaked, he administered to him small
portions of Tourkia bread melted in wine, (which was easily swallowed
thus dissolved) and gently replacing his head upon the cushion of the
mattrass, watched to see him sink again into his medicinal slumber.</p>

<p>The sun was at its meridian height the next day, when the king of
Portugal fully awoke: the good mussulman sat by his bed-side. “How dost
thou feel, my son?” he asked with an air of compassion.</p>

<p>Sebastian drew a sigh from the very depths of his heart. “As one,” he
said, after a long pause; “as one deprived of all that makes life
precious. Tell me, father, what have become of the Christians? I have
yet one Portuguese in Africa?<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_156">{156}</a></span>”</p>

<p>“Alas, my son!” replied the dervise, “they are all slain or taken
captives; but the great Muley Moloch is fallen&#8212;the Xeriffs who fought
against him, are also dead; and now his brother reigns in Morocco.”</p>

<p>Sebastian answered by a heavy groan, and threw himself back upon his
mattrass: the slaughter of his people, pierced him with unutterable
grief; though the consciousness of pious motives, and the certainty that
treachery alone had produced defeat, served to reconcile him to himself.</p>

<p>Oppressed with apprehensions for the fate of Stukeley, and overcome with
the remembrance of many of his followers whom he had loved, and had seen
fall, the unhappy King uttered such deep and doleful groans, that the
dervise believing him concerned at the prospect of slavery, bade him be
of good cheer, and rest assured that he was still free.</p>

<p>“You are not fallen into the hands of a master, but of a friend,” said
the aged<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_157">{157}</a></span> man, “I will but detain you, Sir Knight, till I have healed
your wounds, and then, with the blessing of our holy prophet, we will
journey together to the castle of Tangier: it will not be the first time
that Abensallah has conducted an unhappy christian to his countrymen.”</p>

<p>“And art thou a Mahometan?” exclaimed Sebastian, half raising himself
with surprise, “how is it that thou breathest the very spirit of our
benevolent faith?”</p>

<p>“The same God which spake through the lips of thy <i>Sidie Messika</i>,”
replied the dervise, “inspires the hearts of all good men: besides, we
venerate thy prophet’s moral laws, though Mahomet, a greater prophet
than he, arose to outshine his brightness, as he had before outshone
that of Moses. We are not so unlike in our faith, young soldier, but we
might live in brotherhood on the earth. Would to God! that thy king,
Sebastian, had studi<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_158">{158}</a></span>ed his prophet’s laws more, and his spiritual
superior’s less!”</p>

<p>“Hold, Moor!” cried the King, “I must not hear you impeach the authority
of the representative of St. Peter.”</p>

<p>“Ah, my son!” returned the old man, shaking his grey locks, “dost thou
not remember, that when this Peter struck off the ear of Malchus, though
in defence of his Lord’s sacred person, thy prophet rebuked his zeal,
bidding him put up the sword! How, then, dare the pontiff of Rome turn
his sheep-hook into a weapon of offence?”</p>

<p>Struck with the force of this remark, which he was not prepared to
answer, and disdaining to parry it, by retorting the bloody intolerance
of Mahometanism, Sebastian was silent.</p>

<p>The dervise continued: “But let us not talk of our different creeds at
this period; thou art sick and weak, and I should think of thy suffering
body.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_159">{159}</a></span>”</p>

<p>The good man then dressed his companion’s wounds afresh, and spread
before him palm leaves filled with fruit, together with a cordial drink
and some Pharouk bread: by moderately partaking of these, the King was
so refreshed, that he found himself able to rise, and walk up and down
the cell. As he walked, he conversed courteously with Abensallah, though
his discourse was mingled with many sighs, and he frequently lost
himself in other thoughts.</p>

<p>The dervise noted his dejected looks with benevolent curiosity. “Thou
hast lost, I fear, some dear kinsman in this fatal battle&#8212;some brother,
or father, perhaps; and thy young heart not yet enured to sorrow.”&#8212;</p>

<p>“O, dervise!” exclaimed Sebastian, bursting into an agony of grief,
“every living soul in the Christian army were to me like fathers and
brothers. My countrymen, my brave countrymen! when you marched on so
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_160">{160}</a></span>gallantly, could I have foreseen that I was leading you to&#8212;&#8212;,” he
stopped, then suddenly actuated by one of his rash impulses, abruptly
added&#8212;“Abensallah, you see before you, Sebastian of Portugal.”</p>

<p>The dervise prostrated himself at his feet, “Young monarch, I bow to the
lord’s anointed! thy misfortunes are thy security. Let the conduct of
Abensallah teach thee hereafter to believe that there may be charity
among mussulmen.”</p>

<p>Inexpressibly affected, the King motioned for him to rise, “Abensallah,”
he said, squeezing his hand between both his, “Africa has already taught
me a lesson I shall never forget: but I did not wage war against your
prince from a false notion that he ruled over miscreants. I was actuated
by zeal for that religion which, by limiting the prerogative of kings
and the obedience of subjects, bestows equal blessings upon both. I
would have conquered Africa to have freed her people from tyrannical
rulers and tyrannical<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_161">{161}</a></span> errors, to have afforded them opportunities of
understanding our holy faith; not to have established a new despotism,
and swayed with the iron mace of persecution&#8212;these ardent hopes are
over; you see me here a fugitive, but with God’s leave, a King still.”</p>

<p>As Sebastian spoke the last words, a noble imperiousness sat on his
youthful brow, his heart swelled with it, but quickly sunk again at
recollection of his companions in arms.</p>

<p>Anxious to learn the fate of Stukeley, he besought the dervise to assist
him in ascertaining whether he were dead, or captive; by searching the
field of battle he hoped to arrive at some certainty. Abensallah in vain
remonstrated against this hazardous enterprize, but no arguments availed
with the still imprudent Sebastian; he was therefore reluctantly induced
to propose their going on the night of the ensuing day, when all the
Moors would be engaged in the celebration<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_162">{162}</a></span> of one of their feasts, and
the Portuguese monarch might perhaps pass unnoticed in the dress of a
servant.</p>

<p>During the remainder of the day, Sebastian carefully attended to all the
prescriptions of the dervise, he went soon to rest, and at break of day
rose to breathe the air in safety at the mouth of the cave.</p>

<p>But two short days before, how differently had the king of Portugal
beheld morning dawn!&#8212;then at the head of a gallant army, surrounded by
zealous friends, strong in youth, health, and hope: now, a solitary
fugitive, like some desolate wretch escaped from ship-wreck or an
earth-quake, sunk in despondency, and reduced to infantine feebleness.</p>

<p>As the light spread over the distant plain of Alcazar, and the grey
mists rose, from the stream of the Lucos, he could not refrain from
shedding some tears, they were sacred to the sorrows of all who had lost
friends on that luckless field: his softened heart then turned fondly to
the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_163">{163}</a></span> image of Gonsalva, a treasure which yet remained to comfort him
under affliction. Its heavenly beauty, the dewy smile which sat upon the
lips, the tearful tenderness of the eyes to which a skilful painter had
given all the effect of sadness, renovated his fainting spirit; he
kissed it repeatedly, exclaiming, “At sight of thee, will not all this
be forgotten?”</p>

<p>The appearance of the dervise, checked this lover-like weakness, he
concealed his picture, and advanced to meet him.</p>

<p>They proceeded together along a narrow valley, formed by the rocks near
the cavern, where frequently resting awhile, they breathed the
refreshing air of the trees, and gently returned homeward.</p>

<p>Whenever Abensallah and his servant went to their devotions in the
mosque of a neighbouring village, he fastened the entrance of his
dwelling, to prevent the intrusion of ill-intentioned persons: he now
left his Christian guest, with many intreaties that he would recruit
his<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_164">{164}</a></span> strength with frequent nourishment, and continue to inhale the
fumes of Tauz Argent, a fragrant weed which in those days was esteemed,
when burned, sovereign for inward weakness.</p>

<p>Left a whole day alone, the King had leisure to revolve over the
extraordinary revolution of his fate: the uprightness of his intentions
(for it must be remembered that he measured his conduct by the rules of
the church of Rome) seemed to warrant him in believing, that had not the
treachery of Hamet interposed, his arms must have been successful, and
half Africa rescued from its tyrants: he did not therefore account
himself suffering under the wrath of Heaven, confident of whose favor he
was again ready to risk his crown and his life if required. The kindness
of the dervise appeared little less than a miracle worked for his
preservation, and he fondly trusted therefore, that his present
misfortunes were but passing trials.</p>

<p>Of the possibility of being betrayed by<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_165">{165}</a></span> Abensallah he never once
thought, convinced that the man who has performed one act of solid
benevolence is incapable of being tempted by any reward to an act of
baseness.</p>

<p>As returning strength and calmer reflection continued to banish the
gloomy impressions under which he had first entered Abensallah’s cave,
his spirit rose with his hopes; he felt as if he could hazard unheard-of
perils for the sake of regaining Portugal, and ransoming his captive
soldiers. Fain would the sanguine monarch have persuaded himself that
most of his troops had escaped to the sea-coast; but amongst these he
could not hope to find Stukeley.&#8212;Stukeley, who had sworn to follow him
either into slavery or death!&#8212;</p>

<p>“And my poor little cousin!” he exclaimed aloud, “What is become of
him?&#8212;Ah noble boy, thou hast gained thy wish-perhaps!&#8212;yet surely these
barbarians would not kill a child!”&#8212;he<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_166">{166}</a></span> sighed profoundly as he spoke,
for his heavy heart denied the confidence of his words.</p>

<p>Racked with fearful impatience, to him the day seemed insufferably long:
his devotions were merely short ejaculations breathed over a plain cross
of the order of Christus, which he had worn under his cuirass, yet never
at the foot of the golden crucifix in the church of his ancestors, and
surrounded by all the religious in Portugal, had he prayed with such
warmth or sincerity.</p>

<p>Abensallah did not appear to interrupt his meditations, till night was
begun: cautiously entering, he crossed the first chamber, and advancing
to the interior cell, saw with satisfaction that his guest was safe.
“Alla be praised!” he exclaimed, “I had fears for thee my son; for the
robbers of the mountains sometimes plunder even the dwellings of poor
solitaries.&#8212;We may now venture forth; every one is enjoying the last
hours of<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_167">{167}</a></span> their feast, and we are, sure to pass unseen.”</p>

<p>Sebastian gratefully thanked him, and taking off the coarse vest and
cloak with which the dervise had replaced his uneasy coat of mail,
exchanged them for the still meaner attire of Ismael the servant. At the
mouth of the valley he saw a mule tied to a tree, which Abensallah had
provided for him to ride; this humane attention touched the King; he
was, indeed, ill able to walk far, but it cost him an effort to accept
such accommodation, when the venerable man had no other support than his
staff.</p>

<p>It may truly be said, that at the period which brought him to the
knowledge of Abensallah, Sebastian first tasted the sweet bitterness of
obligation.&#8212;Gratitude is a sentiment unknown to Kings; for having all
things in their power, they learn to believe that they have a right to
command all things. Sebastian, now stripped of that power, began to feel
the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_168">{168}</a></span> original equality of man, and found his heart warmed by a
perception of pure benevolence, hitherto unknown: from this perception
flowed nobler notions of human nature in general, which made him welcome
his new emotion of gratitude, not only as honorable but delightful.</p>

<p>The moon shone cloudless above the rocks and rivulets which lay between
the cave and Alcazar; brightening the tops of the high palms, while the
ground beneath their branches was thrown into deep shadow. Some
fortresses, (visible from afar,) gave an air of warlike severity to the
scene. Sebastian proceeded in silence, for his thoughts were now busied
with mournful anticipations: Abensallah spoke not, and nothing disturbed
the universal stillness but remote bursts of rejoicing from the Moorish
villages.</p>

<p>As they moved among steep and thickly-wooded hills, a new and horrid
sound made the King pause, and look enquiringly at the dervise: “That
comes from amidst<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_169">{169}</a></span> the unburied slain;” Abensallah faulteringly
observed&#8212;“It is the howling of hyenas and tygers.” While speaking, he
took a small harquebuss from under his garment, and prepared to load it.</p>

<p>For the first time in his life Sebastian’s cheek was completely blanched
and his nerves shaken; the ghastly image those words had raised,
momentarily unmanned him, but recovering, by a violent effort, he
quickened the pace of his mule, and came direct upon the plain of
Alcazar.</p>

<p>The moon shining above the arms and armour of the dead, covered them
with a sheet of light: Sebastian hastily put his hand to his eyes, and
remained a few moments without courage to look again; but at the
explosion of Abensallah’s harquebuss, he raised his head and beheld the
beasts of prey which that sound had alarmed, hurrying away, with
backward glare from their horrid banquet.</p>

<p>The dervise’s harquebuss was re-loaded and again fired, till every
savage ani<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_170">{170}</a></span>mal had disappeared; he then assisted his shuddering
companion to dismount, and having fastened the mule to a tree, supported
him across the plain.</p>

<p>Their steps were soon impeded by scattered groups of horses and riders,
that had evidently perished in flight: these groups become more
frequent, till at length the ground was no where visible.</p>

<p>As Sebastian knelt down among these perishing bodies, his senses were
nearly overcome with their noisome exhalations and ghastly appearance:
some of them were half devoured by the wolves, and every trace of the
<i>divine image</i> fearfully effaced: except by their shields and the
caparisons of their horses, he could not have known his most intimate
associates.</p>

<p>Grief and horror become now too strong for outward expression; Sebastian
neither spoke nor sighed, but moved from heap to heap with fixed eyes
and a wan cheek: sometimes he forgot his<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_171">{171}</a></span> errand, and remained gazing on
a confusion of bodies, banners, and arms, till the voice of the dervise
recalled him. “This is a lesson for Kings!”&#8212;said Abensallah;&#8212;Sebastian
shuddered, and at that moment felt as if his single hand had murdered
every victim before him: his countenance expressed this sentiment so
strongly, that the dervise sought to change the current of his feelings
by suggesting, that his friend might have escaped, since they had not
yet found his corpse.&#8212;Revived by this suggestion, the unfortunate
monarch rallied his scattered spirits and proceeded in his painful task.</p>

<p>Advancing a little onward, he stumbled against the venerable bodies of
the bishops of Coimbra and Porto, lying together, embracing the staff of
a standard, which had belonged to the holy banner: a few paces beyond
these, among a heap of swarthy moors,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Like some white poppy sunk upon the plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Whose heavy head was overcharged with rain,”<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_172">{172}</a></span></div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">lay his page, Diego. The noble boy had been killed at the moment his
master’s Arabian was shot, and now lay stretched out beneath it.</p>

<p>At this piteous sight Sebastian’s heart was wrung with an excess of
regret; he burst vehemently into tears, and bending to the fair body as
he raised it, repeatedly kissed the half-closed eyes: their conversation
on the morning of the battle was present to him again.&#8212;Vain prophesy!
here was its fulfilment!&#8212;</p>

<p>Overcome with this recollection, and with the thought of Diego’s
parents, Sebastian staggered as he arose, and was forced to catch at the
dervise for support; another shock awaited him; his eye fell on the
mangled body of Count Vimiosa: his limbs now shook violently, and the
idea of Donna Gonsalva’s grief, displaced every other image. Shocked by
his looks, the dervise caught his arm and hurried him away.</p>

<p>Insensible to any outward sensation,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_173">{173}</a></span> the King suffered himself to be
led along, till suddenly starting from his stupor, he found that they
were many paces from the slain. Abensallah would not hear of returning,
“We must pass three nights there instead of one,” said he, “before we
can examine half that woeful field.&#8212;Let us return then, my son,
trusting that the same merciful providence which succoured thee, has
preserved thy friend. Sorrow and fatigue overcome thee&#8212;lean on my
shoulder&#8212;if we can but reach yonder tower, its walls will shelter us.”</p>

<p>Without answering, Sebastian turned his head back and fixed an earnest
look upon the wide scene of slaughter behind them: fire kindled on his
cheek, and in his eyes:&#8212;it suddenly blazed out.&#8212;“Accursed beyond hope
of mercy,” he cried, “is the soul of him whose treachery caused all
these to perish! from this plain their blood will cry aloud for
vengeance, even at the last dreadful day!”</p>

<p>Exhausted with this momentary trans<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_174">{174}</a></span>port, the enfeebled monarch suffered
his head to fall against the shoulder of Abensallah, who seized the
opportunity of drawing him towards a resting place. The watch-tower in
ruins, and shaded by high cypress trees, stood dark and noiseless; as
they approached it, the sound of their steps alarmed some goats that had
lain down there, and they bounded away: in their flight they rolled
along a broken helmet, which Sebastian immediately recognized; breaking
from Abensallah, he flew to an object under the tower, and beheld the
corpse of Stukeley.&#8212;Throwing himself on the body and clasping it in his
arms, he exclaimed, “O gallant Stukeley, and art thou too, fallen!”</p>

<p>The accidental circumstance of having perished alone, removed from the
contagion of other bodies, and sheltered from hot winds by the tower and
the trees, had preserved the chivalric Englishman from any change: his
features were indeed paler than when in life, but the same<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_175">{175}</a></span> character of
wild sublimity was impressed on them. It seemed as if the soul, in
quitting its mortal habitation had left there the eternal impress of its
own greatness.</p>

<p>The armour of Stukeley was completely rusted with blood, by his side lay
a lance shivered to pieces, and his hand still grasped a broken
battle-axe.</p>

<p>Abensallah lifted up the helmet his companion had dropped, and saw that
it was beat in upon the top, as if with repeated blows of a mace: he
gently replaced it on the ground.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Sebastian hung over the remains of his friend in an agony of
blasted hopes, bitter retrospections, and unavailing regrets: it was
long ere he could command this tide of grief; but recovering by degrees,
he rose with a calmer air, and besought the dervise to lend his aid in
committing the honored clay to earth.</p>

<p>Without hesitation the charitable Mahometan consented to carry the
slaught<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_176">{176}</a></span>ered warrior to his own dwelling, and there see him peacefully
buried.</p>

<p>“Moor!” exclaimed the young King, with passionate gratitude, “Should I
live to regain my kingdom, and with it my African possessions, your
countrymen will owe to you blessings and privileges hitherto unknown.”</p>

<p>Abensallah called on Allah to witness this promise, then hastened away
to bring the mule.</p>

<p>When Sebastian was left alone, he threw himself along the ground by
Stukeley’s body, and remained stedfastly looking on it: the well-known
face, the still ruin, the melancholy midnight, and the destructive plain
before him, together with the mournful sound of a neighbouring rivulet,
deepened the desolate sadness of that moment: he fastened his lips on
the chilling hand of his unconscious friend, while the hollow echo of
his own sighs rung through the neighbouring chambers.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_177">{177}</a></span></p>

<p>Abensallah found him in the same mournful attitude. Having assisted each
other in placing Stukeley’s corse on the mule, they proceeded slowly, by
a longer though less toilsome way than they had come, to the rocks.</p>

<p>When they reached the cave, Sebastian was so sick from the fretting of
his wounds, that he could with difficulty gain its entrance: Ismael met
them, and lifted their lamented burthen into the second chamber. There
the king watched it for the remaining hours, while Ismael and the
dervise were digging the last bed of the hero.</p>

<p>Two hours after day light the grave was finished, Stukeley was buried
with his sword and spurs, as the peculiar badges of knighthood, which
was supposed swift to succour and strong to avenge; his body was wrapped
in a coarse shroud of Moorish cloth, but his head was uncovered; the
thick glossy<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_178">{178}</a></span> hair gave beauty still to the now marble
features:&#8212;Sebastian thought of the time when he had hoped to have
decorated that majestic head with a crown.</p>

<p>When the grave was closed, he placed upon it a rude cross of wood which
he had shaped during the night, and kneeling down by it pronounced a
prayer for the gallant soul. Abensallah and Ismael moved away.</p>

<p>Rising from his knees, the young King attentively surveyed the place,
that he might remember it at a future day; it was particularized by a
few marks not easily forgotten: the place itself was a narrow recess
turning out of the valley; it was half encircled by perpendicular
heights of stupendous steepness, the sides of which were only clothed
with mosses, and at their feet flowed an inconsiderable rivulet; towards
the lower end grew a cluster of locust trees, between which and the
mountain rose Stukeley’s grave.&#8212;So con<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_179">{179}</a></span>cealed, it was not likely that
any human eye would ever discover or disturb the sacred cross.</p>

<p>Somewhat soothed by this thought, and the consciousness of having
performed the last duties to a faithful friend, Sebastian rejoined the
dervise with less emotion. “We must now dismiss painful recollections,”
said the worthy Abensallah, “let us think of nothing, my son, but your
perfect recovery and your safe conveyance from Africa.”</p>

<p>“Ah father,” exclaimed Sebastian, “you speak like a man without hopes
and without regrets!&#8212;Your holy life, exempt from particular affections
or selfish wishes, places <i>you</i> beyond the reach of that grief which
renders it impossible for me <i>to dismiss painful recollections</i>.”</p>

<p>“I am not, therefore, free from sorrow,” replied the dervise, “heedless
youth! I do mourn&#8212;but it is for human nature in general: alas, I mourn
more for its frailties than for its miseries.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_180">{180}</a></span>”</p>

<p>“True&#8212;true&#8212;” repeated Sebastian, smiting his breast&#8212;“you say right,
Abensallah; had we no errors we should have but few sufferings.”</p>

<p>Our dervise, more solicitous to impress humane sentiments than eager to
propagate peculiar tenets, seized this opportunity of discoursing with
much wisdom upon the duties of a sovereign: his companion listened with
attention and replied with frankness.</p>

<p>He detailed with simplicity some of his own plans for diffusing comfort
in more equal proportions through all ranks of his subjects, and noted
the salutary reforms already made by him in the Portuguese government;
he described the liberal mode in which he had intended to conduct his
African conquests, mixing these details with so many just and noble
observations, that Abensallah could not help lamenting the battle of
Alcazar.</p>

<p>To have lived under the rule of a King (though Christian,) who would
have ame<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_181">{181}</a></span>liorated the Moor’s condition by parental care, and sought to
win them into schools and churches, without prohibiting their mosques,
appeared an object of desire, when compared with the grinding tyranny of
their native Xeriffs, and the brutish ignorance to which their laws
condemned them.</p>

<p>Abensallah continued to hear his royal guest with that complacent
pleasure with which virtuous old age perceives generous principles in
youth; but he had lived long enough in the world to know that youth does
not always act in conformity with its principles, nay, that its most
amiable qualities may be wrought by interested persons into a foundation
for the opposite vices. So blindly devoted to the infallibility of papal
authority, and so abhorrent of any religion which disputed it,
Abensallah rightly doubted whether Sebastian, in the event of complete
success, would have persevered in his system of moderation: intolerant
per<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_182">{182}</a></span>secution might have been easily brought to bear the aspect of
religious duty, and that commanded or recommended by a spiritual
superior, would soon have swept away every barrier opposed by a
character naturally candid.</p>

<p>Such reflections as these, by teaching the dervise to consider his
companions’ misfortunes as a necessary discipline, silenced any further
regret; yet Sebastian’s sweet and animated manner had so won upon his
affections, that he could not help exclaiming, “I shall be loth to part
with thee, my son; but we shall meet again in paradise.”</p>

<p>Touched by such kindness, the king pressed Abensallah to accompany him
into Portugal, adding to many arguments the entreaties and promises of a
grateful spirit, conscious of possessing in his own dominions the means
of fulfilling them all.</p>

<p>“Did I live only for myself, answered the dervise, I should perhaps
gladly leave a land where I see nothing but<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_183">{183}</a></span> misery, but the more
miserable it is, the more I am called upon to remain. My holy
profession, and the peaceful life I lead, gives me frequent
opportunities of assisting captives to escape, or of conveying
intelligence from them to the Christian fortresses; if the old man of
the rocks were gone, what would become of these poor strangers?&#8212;Added
to this, I am frequently able to terminate the bloody feuds of my
countrymen&#8212;to restore harmony amongst brethren, and bring back
rebellious children to their parents; these are my treasures, King!
which would be poorly exchanged for all your benefits. I shall however,
bless you daily; and I will preserve from injury the grave of your
departed friend.”</p>

<p>At this mention of Stukeley, clouds gathered over the face of Sebastian;
making an effort to dispel them, he hastily uttered some grateful
expressions, and then discoursed upon the means of dis<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_184">{184}</a></span>covering such of
his subjects as might have survived the battle.</p>

<p>Abensallah promised to make diligent search for such captives, and to
use all his influence for their release.</p>

<p>Sebastian squeezed his hand, exclaiming with generous warmth, “Slacken
not your exertions Abensallah for the meanest of my people; I stand
indebted to every man whom I brought from Portugal for his liberty. If I
part with the whole of my revenue, pawn the jewels of my crown, make
myself a debtor to half the monarchs in Christendom, and after all,
become a beggar throughout my own dominions for contributions and gifts,
I will do it to ransom these gallant sufferers.&#8212;Should I reach Lisbon,
my first step will be to raise money and send it over to the governor of
Tangier; from his hands you will then receive whatever sums may be
needful.”</p>

<p>“And should I in my inquiry, find Christians of other nations, perhaps
aged<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_185">{185}</a></span> men bowed down with sorrow and toil, languishing to die in their
native land&#8212;”</p>

<p>“Ransom them&#8212;ransom them!” interrupted Sebastian, tears glistering in
his eyes, “first restore liberty to my Portuguese, for remember, freedom
is a debt I owe them&#8212;then take all the superflux, and purchase with it
happiness for others. There are two noble Portuguese, Abensallah, whom I
pray you to search for with a father’s anxiety: one is my dearly-loved
cousin, the prior of Crato, the other Don Emanuel de Castro; he saved my
life at Alcazar. When you find these, shew them this ring, and say that
he who gave it you, is alive, and then I hope, in Portugal.”</p>

<p>“How shall I know these gallant gentlemen?” asked the dervise, “you may
know Don Emanuel de Castro,” replied Sebastian, “from all the world:
though you should behold him in the vilest habit and employment, yet
will<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_186">{186}</a></span> such an air of nobleness shine through them, that you cannot help
discovering in him an extraordinary man. He is of larger proportions
than I, his visage oval and full of thought, his complexion dark olive,
his eyes dark grey, somewhat melancholy but very sweet; on his left hand
he has a deep scar, got in the wars of India.</p>

<p>“The prior of Crato is of a different mould: though some years older
than De Castro, he has preserved almost the roundness and floridness of
boyhood; his fair curling hair, light blue eyes, and jovial manner, will
soon point him out: he will rejoice to see this ring!&#8212;and so will De
Castro,” added the King, after a pause, “as it is a token of my safety,
he will rejoice, though it was a gift of Gonsalva’s.”</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">’</span>Tis a fanciful ring for a warrior,” observed the dervise, curiously
eying the bauble, which after the gaudy fashion of<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_187">{187}</a></span> those times was
formed by various precious stones into a miniature garland of flowers.</p>

<p>“Oh father!” exclaimed Sebastian, passionately fixing his eyes on it
also, “that ring was given me by the loveliest and most beloved of
women.&#8212;I have no other token to send to my friends, or I would not part
with that&#8212;it must serve too, as a pledge for the governor of Tangier:
she who gave it knows I would have defended it with my life, and
therefore would not resign it but for the sake of fulfilling a duty.”</p>

<p>Hurried away in thought to the beautiful creature whom this incident
recalled, Sebastian forgot every thing else and sunk into silence: he
dwelt with tender delight upon the unequivocal proof she had given him
of her attachment, which bestowed and avowed ere she could suspect his
royal station, carried with them the charm of disinterestedness. He then
reproached himself for those fantastic jealousies to<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_188">{188}</a></span> which he had
sometimes given way, when he saw her dancing with another, and confessed
now, that her apparent insensibility at times, had arisen only from a
little female coquetry, delighting in power, and willing to prove its
extent.</p>

<p>Thus satisfied with her affection, he felt no apprehension of being
coldly received, because he returned not a conqueror; the Moors
themselves attested his gallant conduct in the field, and the brilliant
success of their onset had shewn, that but for the perfidy of Hamet, the
day would have been won by the Christians.&#8212;What then had he to fear?
perhaps given up as lost, he would return to revive his Gonsalva’s
widowed heart; she would love him the more for his dangers and
distresses, and that delicate pride which had stifled the expressions of
tenderness to a powerful, splendid monarch, would impel her to the same
monarch, become poor and unfortunate.</p>

<p>Observing his guest absorbed in reflec<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_189">{189}</a></span>tions, which from the expression
of his countenance did not appear unpleasant, the worthy Abensallah
gently removed into his outer chamber, for the purpose of giving
audience to some distressed people who came to implore his
counsel.&#8212;Meanwhile Sebastian remained leaning on his rude couch, his
ideas wandering from late sorrow, over the enchanted ground of the more
distant past, till gently wearied, thought glided into dreams, and
dreams at last ended in long and profound sleep.</p>

<p>The wounds of Sebastian and his consequent feebleness now daily
disappeared, and Abensallah was therefore enabled to make longer
excursions from the cave, for the sake of gaining information for his
guest: his habitation, always considered sacred, was not likely to
excite suspicion as a Christian’s hiding place; and even if it did so,
the inner apartment was a secure retreat, being so contrived as to
deceive the most prying observer.&#8212;Ismael’s fidelity had been too often
tried in similar<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_190">{190}</a></span> circumstances to be doubted now, so that Abensallah
left him without apprehension, to attend Sebastian; whom, however, he
knew only as a Portuguese knight.</p>

<p>On the good dervise’s return from Alcazar-quiver, he brought strange
intelligence.&#8212;After the fatal battle, Hamet Abdulcrim, the new emperor,
had strictly enquired for the King of Portugal; he was told that he had
fallen: this assertion having been made by Don Nugno De Mascarenhas, the
King’s chief equerry, he was sent to the field in order that he might
produce a proof of his veracity by finding the King’s body.</p>

<p>In the place he described, was indeed found a corpse in green armour,
much maimed and disfigured: the Portuguese who saw it, confessed it to
be that of their sovereign, and therefore assured Hamet Abdulcrim that
any farther search for Sebastian alive, was useless.&#8212;Information of his
nephew’s death was now forwarded to Philip of Spain, (the late Xeriff
having<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_191">{191}</a></span> been in alliance with him,) and when Abensallah heard the tale,
a messenger from Madrid was hourly expected to beg the body, and to
procure the release of some Castillian prisoners.</p>

<p>On first hearing this account, Sebastian’s inflammable blood took fire,
for he believed himself wilfully abandoned by his people; but the next
instant made him cool again. It was impossible not to perceive that
Marcarenhas, who had always loved his master, could be only actuated by
the desire of facilitating his concealment in Barbary, should he be
living, and seeking the means of escape; this well-meant deceit had
evidently given a hint to the other persons examined by the Xeriff, and
to it, probably Sebastian might finally owe his preservation.</p>

<p>Neither the King nor the dervise could approve of absolute falsehood;
though they were tempted to think it excusable, under such peculiar
circumstances as the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_192">{192}</a></span> present, flowing as it did from loyal zeal and
patriotic considerations.</p>

<p>Alarmed at the diffusion of such an error throughout Europe, Sebastian’s
anxiety to revisit Portugal became extreme; but as they must travel on
foot, Abensallah assured him that it would be culpable rashness to
commence a long journey before he was completely restored to health;
Arzile, the nearest Christian fortress, lay at some leagues distance,
and to avoid notice, they must take a circuitous route thither, hiding
themselves in the day, and proceeding through the changeable air of
night.</p>

<p>Sebastian’s impatient nature was ill-suited to any delay, but necessity
is an imperious mistress; he was therefore obliged to turn his attention
towards acquiring health; and by obliging Abensallah on that point,
facilitate the hour of their departure.</p>

<p>Each night and morning he now tried<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_193">{193}</a></span> his strength among the mountains,
in excursions of increasing length, gradually habituating himself to
heat, fatigue, and evening damps: his wounds were at last thoroughly
healed, and even the dervise could no longer refuse assent to the fresh
glow that began to mantle on his cheek.</p>

<p>Sebastian’s eagerness had nobler sources than selfish satisfaction; he
lamented every hour thus wasted at a distance from the kingdom where all
his duties were centred, he wished to ease the hearts of such as mourned
him dead, and above all to commence the promised work of liberation for
his followers: it must be confessed that the prospect of again beholding
Donna Gonsalva, and of restoring her to happiness, gave additional
ardour to those honourable anxieties.</p>

<p>When his importunity finally prevailed on Abensallah to fix the day for
their departure, pleasure sparkled in his eyes;<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_194">{194}</a></span> it was the first time
pleasure had appeared there since he had seen the dervise.</p>

<p>“Ah my son!” exclaimed the holy man, “thou must suffer many more sorrows
I fear, ere the spirit that breaks forth in that bright light is finally
quenched.”</p>

<p>“And why should it be quenched?” asked the young monarch.</p>

<p>“Because, replied Abensallah, it is full of an extravagant hope of such
unfading raptures as are only to be found in paradise. ’Tis the very
spirit of youth which falsely believes all it loves, immutable: Time
that shews thee the mutability of every thing, even of human character
(for alas! how insecure sometimes is virtue herself,) will extinguish,
or give a new direction to this erring fire.&#8212;Hast thou my son never
felt, even in the midst of what is called felicity, a sort of feebleness
in thy power of enjoyment, which seemed to make happiness mock thy very
grasp? commune with a beloved friend, behold this<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_195">{195}</a></span> glorious scene of
earth and heaven, and thou wilt acknowledge, even at the moment of
liveliest emotion, that in all sublunary things we feel the want of some
faculty by which we might enjoy or possess them more intimately: this
faculty, whatever it may be, is doubtless reserved for another state of
being. Turn and plant thy thoughts then on sublimer objects: with views
thus changed, thou wilt no longer hurry impatiently through life, in
search of that blessedness for which our souls are expressly formed, but
will journey calmly on towards the eternal abiding place, where our
Creator treasures up for the faithful, raptures ineffable.”</p>

<p>“I am not unmindful of that glorious eternity, be assured, good father,”
returned the King, “yet I frankly acknowledge, that unless I were to
believe in the permanence of human excellence, long known and long
tried, life would not merely lose its charm, but become hateful to me.
In yon humble grave lies one, who, had he<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_196">{196}</a></span> lived, I could have anchored
my soul on. Yes, gallant Stukeley! our knot of love was soon broken, but
the memory of thy noble and endearing qualities can never leave me!”</p>

<p>At this short apostrophe to his friend, Sebastian’s animation
disappeared, and a train of reflections succeeded, well calculated to
amend and to enlarge his heart.</p>

<p>The ensuing night having been fixed on for their journey, Abensallah and
Ismael went in the evening of the present day, to a neighbouring
village, for the purchase of such portable provisions as would be
requisite to take with him: left free to range over the valley,
Sebastian’s steps naturally turned to the resting place of his friend,
as he was so soon to quit it never to return; but it was among his
mental promises to have the honoured dust transferred to Portugal when
he should return thither.</p>

<p>The shadows of evening were now deepening, the gloom of the rocks as he
passed<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_197">{197}</a></span> along; though the sun had been long set, the air burnt like a
furnace; the ground too was scorching; and the colour of the verdure
being lost in the grey of twilight, contributed with this unrelenting
heat, to give an air of savage sterility to the scene.</p>

<p>Dried up by powerful suns, the mountain stream was known only by its
stony channel; Sebastian hastily crossed it, and pushing through the
matted boughs of the locust trees, a solitary bird shot from amongst
them, and startled him with her piercing cry; long after she was flown,
he stood listening to her fearful echo.</p>

<p>What a spot for the last bed of a hero! yet Stukeley slept in it
undisturbed!</p>

<p>Never before, had death been so impressed on the senses of the young
monarch. The desolation of the place, its now awful stillness, the
deepening twilight, the devouring element by which he was surrounded,
(for he knew not how to deem it air) and the strong contrast to<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_198">{198}</a></span> them in
his own animated hopes and busy thoughts, agitated him strangely; he
stood as if transfixed, gazing on the mound of earth, without venturing
to pollute what seemed to him so sacred, even by an embrace.</p>

<p>He was roused from this trance by the sound of voices; one resembled
that of the dervise, and it was calling on Alla for succour: regardless
of personal risque (though unarmed,) Sebastian rushed into the valley,
and soon reached the spot whence these cries proceeded; an aged Moor was
struggling with a band of robbers; though not Abensallah, he could not
refrain from bursting upon the plunderers, and attacking them with the
limb of a tree, which, blown off by some storm, had lain luckily in his
path.</p>

<p>The blows of this unwieldy club, falling with inconceivable rapidity on
every side, soon obliged the robbers to quit their prey, and turn on
their new antagonist;<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_199">{199}</a></span> they surrounded him, attacked him fiercely with
their horrid knives, and one of them, succeeding in stabbing him behind,
he dropped from loss of blood.</p>

<p>Enraged at the escape of their first victim, (a rich merchant, who had
been coming to ask the prayers of Abensallah,) the Alarbes, or mountain
dwellers, as they are called, were on the point of wholly sacrificing
the royal Portuguese to their vengeance, when a faint flash of lightning
cast a gleam over his breast, and discovered through the folds of his
coarse galebia, the costly setting of Donna Gonsalva’s picture; the head
of the band immediately seized this precious prize, and soon lost in
admiration of the diamonds all ideas of slaughter; he now ordered <i>the
Christian dog</i> (as he scornfully termed his captive,) to be lifted on a
mule, directing one of the men to bandage his wound, and ride on the
same beast.</p>

<p>Totally unconscious of what was doing,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_200">{200}</a></span> having fainted from effusion of
blood, the ill-starred monarch was lifted up, and placed before one of
the Alarbes; the fellow spurred his beast, and followed by the whole
troop, set off on full gallop out of the valley.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_201">{201}</a></span></p>

<h2><a id="CHAP_V"></a>CHAP. V.</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">When</span> Sebastian was again capable of observation, he found himself in the
heart of almost impenetrable mountains, surrounded by savage tribes,
living in tents made of the bark and leaves of the palm-tree. These
wretches seemed to have just as much civilization amongst them as
rendered their vices more hideous, by taking from them the plea of
ignorance: their business was plunder and murder; their pleasures,
drunkenness and debauchery.</p>

<p>The habits of such a people were a constant source of horror and
indignation to Sebastian; of their barbarous jargon indeed he knew
nothing, but the force of these robbers’ passions imparted a detestable
expressiveness to every action of their bodies and features, which made<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_202">{202}</a></span>
him but too well comprehend their ferocity and their profligacy.</p>

<p>Hitherto a surly old woman had dressed his wound, and supplied him with
food, and from her he vainly attempted to obtain by signs Donna
Gonsalva’s picture: she either did not or would not understand him.</p>

<p>Maddened by this loss, and desperate of release, ignorant of the place
where he was, and hopeless therefore of escaping, he began to disregard
life: neither the threats nor the violence of the Alarbes prevailed to
alter his resolution of never submitting to the base occupations they
assigned him; he was a monarch still, though deprived of his people and
of liberty; and whether he lived or died, he was resolved to live or die
undebased by submission to miscreants.</p>

<p>The firmness with which he endured all their torments, at first
astonished, and at length exasperated, his brutal captors; they suffered
him to behold the beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_203">{203}</a></span> image of Gonsalva (now robbed of its
setting) polluted by their brutish admiration, but steadily withheld it,
in defiance of his frantic entreaties, his rash attempts to regain it,
or his offer of treasures in exchange.</p>

<p>One day when Sarhamet the chief had exasperated him beyond controul, by
deridingly kissing the picture, his fury burst forth so fearfully, that
the Alarbe sprung out of his reach, and hastily dashed the contested
object into one of the neighbouring torrents: nothing short of regaining
his treasure could have given the captive King such joy; his wrath
suddenly ceased, he dropt the arm just raised to elance a mortal blow,
and approaching the torrent, beheld with satisfaction the divine colours
of the portrait effaced by its foaming waters; he then turned quietly
away, and returned to his former station.</p>

<p>Tranquillized by the certainty that his Gonsalva’s representative was
thus rescued<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_204">{204}</a></span> from profanation, he was able to controul his indignation
at other circumstances, and to strive at obtaining his own freedom; but
though he endeavoured to explain to these banditti, that if they would
convey him to a Christian fortress they should be liberally paid, and
loaded with gifts, they either did not comprehend, or much mistrusted
his veracity: at length, wearied, out by his stedfast character, and
tempted by the great price given for handsome Europeans by the Moorish
grandees, Sarhamet meditated selling him.</p>

<p>This information, which was meant to vex, rather gratified their
prisoner; to be again brought into the plains, was to be once more
placed within prospect of liberty, and chance of meeting the reverend
Abensallah: Sebastian’s health returned with hope; for though his last
wound had been deep, it had been skilfully managed; and the purity of a
good constitution, adding force to an invincible spirit, enabled him to
bear without injury the piercing<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_205">{205}</a></span> mountain air, and the frequent fasts
to which the Alarbes had wantonly doomed him.</p>

<p>His improving looks quickened the eagerness of Sarhamet for selling him:
solicitous to secure the moment of procuring a high price for his
captive, the robber selected a dozen followers, and mounting them and
Sebastian upon stout Barbs, set off with them one morning by day break,
for the country house of a Moorish grandee.</p>

<p>Sarhamet and his brother rode on each side of the King; they were armed
with guns and Moorish knives, and made signs to him, that if he
attempted to escape, he must inevitably fall by the hands of the troops
escorting them, whose naked weapons were placed in their girdles ready
for that purpose:&#8212;Sebastian smiled, and motioned acquiescence; but it
was a grievous smile, “as if he disdained himself” for so submitting to
fortune.</p>

<p>Their journey was long and wearisome:<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_206">{206}</a></span> the Alarbes, enured to every
change of climate, travelled indifferently through nightly dews and
noon-day heats; sometimes they halted after a burning day, upon the very
summit of a snow-topt mountain, where they supped, and slept, with no
other covering than the clouds; at other times they would journey
through the night, and lay themselves to rest in valleys, among
scorching rocks, that reflected thrice the heat of the sun.</p>

<p>Sebastian contemplated this iron strength, with something like envy: by
rendering a man’s body independent, it gives additional stability to the
freedom of his mind; he felt conscious that, had he been thus
disciplined into invulnerable strength, he might have attempted, and
perhaps effected his escape: but the intense heats had re-opened his
last wound, and had in consequence so reduced his natural vigour, that
he could not hope to succeed, though he should master two Alarbes who
constantly watched him<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_207">{207}</a></span> while the others slept. Completely unarmed, and
cautiously removed from the spot where the horses were fastened, he was
aware, that a contest with one Moor must awaken the others, and that he
should perish under their daggers long before he could meet any shelter:
by acquiescing at present, he might obtain his object hereafter; in the
neighbourhood of a populous city, less hazardous means might be found,
and Providence might again throw Abensallah in his way, or some
christian friend, with whom he might share in an attempt at mutual
deliverance.</p>

<p>These thoughts often occupied him, as he rested or rode among his
ferocious companions; and still hope filled his sanguine breast,
pointing to his country and to Gonsalva.</p>

<p>From the length of their journey, Sebastian conjectured that his late
residence had been at the extremity of the Benzeroel mountains; he had
therefore been in the same tract of country with the bene<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_208">{208}</a></span>volent
dervise, and was now far distant from him: at thought of never seeing
him again, his feelings saddened, gliding naturally from Abensallah to
the gallant Stukeley, and thence to the slaughter of Alcazar.</p>

<p>On the fourteenth day, Sarhamet exchanged his prisoner’s worn-out
galebia for a coarse, but more becoming habit, telling him that they
were on the point of finishing their career: Sebastian for the first
time enquired the name and rank of the person to whom they were now
going; he learnt in reply, that he was the Almoçadem of a cavila, (that
is, governor of a province) high in favour of the reigning Xeriff,
(having ably assisted in securing him the throne) and highly respected
throughout Barbary. His dwelling was in the Valley of Palms, a
delightful place, nearly three leagues beyond Mequinez.</p>

<p>After bathing, and re-dressing themselves, the whole party mounted their
horses, and proceeded down a winding<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_209">{209}</a></span> declivity into a most luxuriant
vale: the country-house of El Hader lay before them. Having been a royal
gift, the building was a moorish Cassavee of much magnificence, covering
with its interior gardens, squares, piazzas, and baths, an extent of
four miles. Sebastian paused awhile, admiring its rude splendor.</p>

<p>The high dome of green and gold, the tall cypress trees which appeared
rising above the gilded railings of the squares, the fountains of white
and azure marble, the gay piazzas chequered with coloured tiles, the
lofty columns and massy arches, all presented a semblance of regal
grandeur, which made his heart spring back to Ribera and Xabregas. The
contrast of his situation now, with what it had been when in those
beloved places, almost unmanned him; their scenes were so associated
with the idea of Donna Gonsalva, that it was impossible for him not to
heave some profound sighs as he entered the dwelling of a Moorish
nobleman, a prisoner and a slave.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_210">{210}</a></span></p>

<p>Sarhamet, with his brother and their captive, was admitted into a lower
hall of the Cassavee, whence they were soon after led into the presence
of the Almoçadim.</p>

<p>As the young and imperious King of Portugal passed through a crowd of
Moors to the audience chamber of El Hader, and reflected that he was
going to be sold for a price, like some ignoble animal, his heart might
well be said to “grow too big for what contained it;” he was on the
point of madly rushing upon all surrounding him, and so purchasing
freedom with life. Had he not happily remembered that Portugal claimed a
sacrifice at his hands, and that it was his duty to suffer, in the hope
of living to repair the unintentional calamity he had caused her, his
rashness must have transported him into violence that would have ended
in his own destruction.</p>

<p>Fervently calling on every saint to endue him with patience, he walked
slowly after Sarhamet, with a resolution of no<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_211">{211}</a></span> longer observing the
minutiæ of his fate: thus influenced, he scarcely noticed the
approbation of El Hader and his retainers, but stood silent, wrapped up
in his cloak, wilfully inattentive to the long bargaining of the Alarbe,
and the enormous price at length paid down for him.</p>

<p>When the bargain was concluded, Sarhamet departed; the Almoçadem then
addressed his new slave in vile Portuguese, telling him to adore Alla,
for having advanced him to so high an honour as that of serving the
greatest man throughout the Xeriff’s dominions; promising, in
consideration of the christian’s fine appearance, to make him one of his
household slaves.</p>

<p>The sentence of death would have been more grateful to Sebastian than
this degrading favour. What! was he, a christian king, the descendant of
kings, to wait upon an accursed infidel, and learn obedience to his nod?
No, he would rather perish, he would suffer for his<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_212">{212}</a></span> beloved country and
for his friends all that pain, sorrow, and want, could inflict, he would
for their sakes bend to almost any mortification; but it was impossible
for him to yield to base servitude, and become the domestic servant of a
Mahometan. Resolute to die in this determination, he calmly repeated it
to El Hader, protesting he would only labour in the manly occupation of
really useful work, the employments of the field.</p>

<p>The Almoçadem was a good-humoured, indolent man, not easily moved to
wrath; surprized, therefore, but not irritated, he turned to his
interpreter, bidding him ask the foolish christian if he knew the
difference between a household and a field slave. The man who repeated
the question, ended it by an explanation of the situations, assuring
Sebastian, that if he remained in the Cassavee he would be superbly
dressed, delicately fed, and comfortably lodged; that all his business
would be to wait at his lord’s back with<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_213">{213}</a></span> his hookha, or ride out when
he went a hunting, with his lances and arrows: that, on the contrary, if
he persisted in joining the field slaves, he would be doomed to hard
fare, and worse lodging, and be urged to the most laborious tasks by
stripes and blows.</p>

<p>At the last words, Sebastian’s eyes sparkled with fury, “Mark me, Moor!”
he cried in a dreadful voice, “I am a man that will not survive
disgrace: by the immortal heavens! if but the shadow of one of your
whips ever falls upon this body, I will wash out the stain in blood!
Beware then!”</p>

<p>The Africans looked on each other with astonishment: the Almoçadem
smiled. “We shall see! we shall see!” he repeated carelessly, “if you do
your duty I give orders that you shall not be beaten; but I must have
all my slaves do their duty; so do you hear, don’t abuse my goodness by
insolence and idleness. What are you, young man?&#8212;How did you get<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_214">{214}</a></span> into
that rogue, Sarhamet’s hands?&#8212;Were you one of the mad-headed followers
of the mad King Sebastian?”</p>

<p>The captive monarch’s blood crimsoned his face: “I <i>was</i> in the battle
of Alcazar,” he said proudly, “and were I free this moment, would again
follow the royal-standard of Portugal over the plains of Barbary. The
mad Sebastian, as you call him, on that day made the stoutest hearts in
Morocco tremble.&#8212;May he live to make them quake again! I saw your
routed Moors flying before him like scattered sheep!&#8212;the field was
ours, till one of your infidel race, the detested Muley Hamet, turned
like a traitor upon the troops he was affecting to aid.&#8212;”</p>

<p>“He did right,” interrupted El Hader, “by so doing he made his peace
with Mahomet, and gained Paradise. But how could your hot-brained King
build on the faith of a man who had broken his faith with the prophet by
leaguing with christians? Ah! I see that touches you,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_215">{215}</a></span>&#8212;well, they are
both gone to settle their accounts together in the other world.”</p>

<p>As he concluded, the Almoçadem turned to his interpreter, “Ephra, we
must give this christian fool his choice; you know I am always desirous
of leaving my slaves to experience.&#8212;Conduct him to field-work; and
then, if he continues to despise the honor of attending upon me here, we
must leave him to his fate.&#8212;Bid him withdraw.”</p>

<p>As El Hader rose while he was speaking, Sebastian naturally coincided
with the movement, and turned away; he was therefore spared the
mortification of being told to depart.</p>

<p>Ephra conducted him towards a long piazza, through which they passed
into a large paved court, where several slaves were refreshing
themselves between their hours of labour: struggling with his imperious
nature, the unhappy monarch neither saw nor heard any thing, till a
passionate exclamation, in pure Portu<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_216">{216}</a></span>guese, struck his ear; he turned
hastily round and beheld a young man, (whose face he remembered to have
seen amongst his troops,) who dropping upon one knee, repeated in
whispers&#8212;“O sire! what a change is this.”</p>

<p>Many and powerful were the reasons of Sebastian for remaining unknown to
the Moors, but his feelings, ever superior to selfish prudence, now
mocked controul; he stopt, and extended both his hands, which the
soldier eagerly kissed; he would have spoken, but the words died on his
lips: the Portuguese recovering from his transport of mixed emotion,
into sorrow and habitual reverence, fearfully relinquished his
sovereign’s hand, and turned aside to conceal some tears: Ephra rudely
advanced and asked the meaning of this scene.</p>

<p>Before Sebastian could reply, the young soldier gently answered, that he
was overcome by unexpectedly finding his commanding officer in the new
slave,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_217">{217}</a></span> then he prayed permission to converse with him awhile, after
which he would return to his occupations with redoubled diligence.</p>

<p>Ephra was a man not easily moved: he coldly denied this indulgence,
telling the Portuguese to mind his present superiors and forget his past
ones, adding sarcastically, “whoever your captain is, whether Don or
Hidalgo, he is now a slave like yourself.”</p>

<p>Without venturing to remonstrate, the poor youth bowed and disappeared,
while Ephra morosely continued to precede his royal companion.</p>

<p>Every thing now was unnoticed by Sebastian: this accidental meeting with
one of his subjects had subdued him; the sound of those few words
pronounced in their native accent, brought into his mind such crouds of
tender and affecting images, that his heart was compleatly softened:
until this moment he had felt utterly abandoned, and now the unexpected<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_218">{218}</a></span>
proof of being still loved and honored, even by one he might be said to
have injured, affected him to weakness.</p>

<p>It <i>was</i> the weakness of Sebastian to wish for the love of his fellow
creatures: time, only, could teach him to be contented with their
esteem.</p>

<p>Having conducted his melancholy companion through the obscurest parts of
the Cassavee, Ephra brought him into a large square of ground surrounded
by mean buildings, where a number of Christians were at work: this place
contained the slaves’ habitations, and was under the direction of a
governor, whose office it was to see the several tasks fulfilled, and at
night to lock up all the captives in their miserable lodgings.</p>

<p>At sight of a new victim, this man came forward; “Here, Ben Tarab,”
cried Ephra, “our illustrious master has sent you this refractory
Christian to teach obedience; give him work, and see that he does not
attempt to escape: if you do<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_219">{219}</a></span> not present him to the great El Hader when
next he calls for him, your head will answer it.”</p>

<p>Ben Tarab bowed submissively, and Ephra left the court.</p>

<p>Sebastian’s eyes meanwhile were anxiously employed in scrutinizing the
persons around him: they were Christians of all nations, some very old,
others in the tender spring of life; but blood-drinking care, and
flesh-consuming toil had left their traces on the youngest cheeks: every
countenance was wan, every figure emaciated.</p>

<p>Amongst the various groups, he sought in vain for his cousin Antonio, or
Don Emanuel de Castro; none but strange faces met his gaze, and as no
one recognized him, he rightly concluded that none of his own army were
amongst them.</p>

<p>Sebastian wished not for partners in affliction; and though anxiety led
him to seek for Crato and de Castro, he was<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_220">{220}</a></span> gladdened by not finding
them under the task-masters of El Hader.</p>

<p>Ben Tarab soon assigned him a portion of labour: too much occupied with
reflections on the miserable lot of others, to think any longer of his
own, Sebastian performed his task mechanically, while viewing the scene
before him.&#8212;In one quarter were groups of captives employed in
stamping, with heavy weights, the damp earth with which the Moors form
the walls of their inferior buildings; others were labouring to prepare
this earth out of various materials; others again bringing sand, bricks,
and lime, in loaded baskets upon their heads; while some were hewing
stone, sawing wood, melting lead, or moulding ornaments for the nobler
parts of the Cassavee.</p>

<p>Fainting with heat, toil, and thirst, these unhappy people were yet
urged to their tasks with imprecations and blows; neither age nor
infirmities pleaded for a moment’s indulgence: they toiled on,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_221">{221}</a></span> consumed
by scorching suns, and unrefreshed by a single breeze.</p>

<p>The sighs and groans of the Christians pierced the heart of Sebastian;
he heard them with anguish, for he was no longer that Sebastian whose
nod could give liberty; a slave now, he had nothing to bestow but inward
prayers for himself and for them.</p>

<p>Perceiving his new workman totally ignorant of labour, Ben Tarab roughly
told him to observe how others did, and so learn the trade of
them.&#8212;“What, I suppose you have been what Christian dogs call a
gentleman, and therefore are good for nothing:&#8212;I have always ten times
the trouble with gentlemen; they are either insolent, lazy, or stupid,
and are only fit to do the work of horses or asses; one poor fellow is
worth a thousand of you.&#8212;We never promote gentlemen here, so you may
reckon soon upon being sent into the open country to draw the
water-waggons, or dig for lime.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_222">{222}</a></span>&#8212;Why the plague am I to be troubled
with you?&#8212;could not you have been kept amongst the household pack?”</p>

<p>The rage which seemed ready to burst in thunder from Sebastian,
evidently intimidated Ben Tarab; he moved nimbly out of the reach of his
arm, muttering in a sullen tone, “Get on with your job&#8212;do as well as
you can.”</p>

<p>Recovering his self-command, the young King turned scornfully away, and
pursued his occupation; it was chipping marble: The comparative easiness
and delicacy of this employment, when contrasted with that of others,
made him believe that he owed some gratitude even to Ben Tarab, for
having thus favored him, he was therefore resolved to disregard in
future the brutal language of the man, and think only of escaping insult
by discharging his portion of labour.</p>

<p>In spite of this resolution he could never again look at Ben Tarab
without something so alarming in his eyes, that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_223">{223}</a></span> Moor feared to
approach him, he shewed him his daily tasks, not daring to threaten any
punishment for their non-fulfilment, and at length, sick of such
restraint, offered to remove him into a different department. Sebastian
caught at the proposal; he was solicitous to see all the slave of the
Almoçadem, and frequently wished to meet once more with the young
soldier whose dutiful remembrance had affected him so much.</p>

<p>“I perceive,” said Ben Tarab, “that you know nothing of the works we do
here, and perhaps some other might suit your capacity better; every man
has not the gift of doing all things.&#8212;We have slaves, now, that
manufacture powder, and armour, and cast cannon; do you like that
business?&#8212;What! you’re afraid of such combustibles?&#8212;You change colour
at the very mention of them: there you and I agree.&#8212;We have others that
hew and drag timber, some that get in our three harvests, some that make
bricks,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_224">{224}</a></span> and a few that work in the great El Hader’s gardens.&#8212;I can
promote you to any of these departments if you know how to be thankful
for such a favor.”</p>

<p>“I know how to be thankful;” said Sebastian gently, “give me any
occupation so it be but in the fresh air of heaven, and require little
more than <i>bodily</i> exertion, and I will thank you sincerely.”&#8212;</p>

<p>“Well then,” replied the Moor, “you may as well change into the gardens;
there you will have nothing to do, but trudge about, pruning and
digging, fetching water from the fountains to the baths, plenty to do,
and nothing to crack your brains with thinking of: if you behave well,
and shew any signs of <i>rare sagacity</i>, you may get <i>promoted</i>, and
become at last, <i>fruit-gatherer</i> and <i>flower-gatherer</i> for the
<i>women</i>.”&#8212;</p>

<p>“Ben Tarab!” said Sebastian, after a thoughtful pause, disregarding the
brute’s contemptuous air, “Is there any offer that could persuade you
into becoming<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_225">{225}</a></span> my friend?&#8212;procure for me permission to send to one of
the Portuguese forts, and I will not only engage to be ransomed at a
high price, but will faithfully promise you a hundred gold crowns for
your kindness.”</p>

<p>“So then, you <i>are</i> a nobleman?” replied Ben Tarab, attentively eyeing
him, “I thought so the moment I saw you: but hark ye my friend, the
great El Hader prides himself upon despising ransoms; if the King of
Portugal himself were living, and a slave within these walls, he must
offer a thousand of such crowns as that he was crowned with, before he
could move a true Mussulman: Slaves here, are slaves for life; and I
hate you all too cordially ever to betray my trust and risk my neck for
such scoundrels.”</p>

<p>As Ben Tarab ended, he disappeared with a malicious grin, and in a short
time re-entered with an older Moor, who looked awhile at Sebastian, and
then conducted him out of the court: the latter follow<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_226">{226}</a></span>ed his steps in
silence, strongly wrestling with his own outraged feelings, which were
almost chafed into fury, by the mingled malice and cowardice of Ben
Tarab.</p>

<p>After traversing several open quadrangles and stone galleries, they came
at length to the gardens: they were admitted through magnificent gates,
curiously wrought in open work of cast iron, and covered with gilding;
as he entered, Sebastian felt an emotion long unknown to him, an emotion
of delight.</p>

<p>The gardens were spacious and verdant, beautified with marble fountains
and canals; their terraces were shaded by tall trees of the freshest
green, and the air that fanned them was impregnated with the perfume of
orange flowers.</p>

<p>Sebastian could not respire air thus perfumed, without instantly
thinking of the gardens of Count Vimiosa; the first day he had seen
Donna Gonsalva came back to his recollection with all the force<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_227">{227}</a></span> of a
present scene: he stopt, cast his eyes round, scarcely breathed, almost
expecting to see her celestial beauty advance from some of the
groves:&#8212;But he saw no one, till his conductor led on still further, and
brought him to a spot where a few slaves were employed in cutting a
subterraneous passage, from a bower of Arabian jessamine, to one of the
baths.&#8212;Stopping at this place, the Moor shewed the King his new
occupation.</p>

<p>After toiling in silence till long past sunset, the slaves were
dismissed to their distant lodgings, where a miserable supper awaited
them.</p>

<p>On re-entering the court where he had first laboured, Sebastian did not
see Ben Tarab, he passed slowly along, noting every fresh group of new
faces, without finding any that he knew: at length he perceived a
cluster of Christians gathered round one who was sitting with a rude
guitar in his hand, playing the symphony of a song; the King approached,
and re<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_228">{228}</a></span>cognized the soldier, Gaspar. The young man, without observing
him, began to sing with little voice, and less skill, but infinite
feeling, these stanzas.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“O Time! thy waves that might have rolled<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thro’ channels gay with bordering roses,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now slow and sad and sunless flow<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where not one flower its bloom discloses:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Say, will the blushing wreaths of joy<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Beside thy waters blossom ever,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sweets like breath of angels, throw<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Around the purple wings of Zephyr?”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>As he was going to repeat the song, his eyes met those of the King, and
a flush of joyful surprize covered his pallid face; he rose hastily,
reminded his comrades of supper, and in the midst of their tumultuous
movements, drew near to one of the houses: he then glided in at an open
door, making a sign for Sebastian to follow.</p>

<p>The King obeyed: no sooner were they alone, than Gaspar cast himself at
the feet of his sovereign, uttering in a low<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_229">{229}</a></span> voice the most affecting
expressions of sorrow and of respect, deploring the fate of Portugal,
thus deprived of her protector, and beseeching him to order his services
and his life in any way conducive to his comfort.</p>

<p>Sebastian could not conceal his emotion: he raised Gaspar from the
ground, with many gracious acknowledgements, assuring him that the only
service he could do him would be to discover whether a ransom would
indeed be refused by El Hader, or to aid in their mutual
escape.&#8212;Gaspar’s answer destroyed every hope.</p>

<p>He represented that the Almoçadem avowedly picqued himself upon never
giving liberty to the enemies of Mahomet; that as the whole of the
domains were inclosed by high walls, and these regularly guarded day and
night, the escape of a prisoner was impossible; nay, that even such
captives as worked in the fields and quarries, were watched by Moors
com<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_230">{230}</a></span>pletely armed, therefore as hopeless of escape as the household
servants.</p>

<p>“For myself, I scarcely care,” said the young soldier, (tears starting
into his eyes even while he believed himself thus indifferent;) “but to
behold my King so fated, drives me to desperation.&#8212;My life, sire, is of
no consequence&#8212;except to a widowed mother and sisters, whom your royal
bounty will hereafter save from want&#8212;perhaps you would deign to accept
of my attempting something for your sake; should I fail, it will be
nothing; I shall die in the performance of a duty; should I succeed,
Portugal will owe her happiness to me.”</p>

<p>“What is it you would attempt?” asked Sebastian, seeing Gaspar too much
affected to proceed.</p>

<p>“To scale the walls,” exclaimed the breathless soldier, “to flee by
unfrequented ways to the nearest fortress, to convey thither the blessed
tidings of my sovereign’s safety, and either return with a<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_231">{231}</a></span> royal
ransom, or joined by every Portuguese in Africa, march hither, storm the
Cassavee, and&#8212;&#8212;.”</p>

<p>“Brave Gaspar!” exclaimed the youthful monarch, animated with similar
ardour, “Thou hast the heart of a knight: should we ever reach Portugal,
claim knighthood at my hand. But I cannot accept of freedom on such
terms; too many gallant soldiers have already been sacrificed by my
imprudent reliance on the faith of a traitor: neither the lives nor the
properties of my subjects shall be lavished to purchase my liberty. If
these wretches knew my real rank, half my kingdom would not satisfy
their avarice. No! let us trust to Providence.&#8212;I will watch the
opportune moment like a lynx. I will try every method to bribe my
gaolers&#8212;if I escape at last, be assured, Gaspar, I will remember you.”</p>

<p>Gaspar was going to press his former petition, when the sound of Ben
Tarab’s horrid voice made him stop: “We must part, sire,” he exclaimed,
“haste&#8212;mix<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_232">{232}</a></span> with the crowd&#8212;we meet again to-morrow night.” While
speaking, he hurried the King out of the house, and they were
immediately absorbed by the multitude without.</p>

<p>Ben Tarab kept at a distance from Sebastian, who could not help smiling
at his mixture of ferocity and meanness: it was soon bed time; and the
slaves, separating, the King retired to a scattering of bean-straw in
the corner of a brick-room, where he threw himself beside four other
captives, and sunk, overpowered with sleep.</p>

<p>The break of day awoke him to the same toil, and the hour of supper
again allowed him a short conversation with Gaspar. Every day brought
with it but fresh causes for regret, while it diminished the delusions
of hope. But where is the situation, however desolate, out of which it
is impossible for us to extract some consolation? Sebastian found in his
present state, a balm for part of that<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_233">{233}</a></span> remorse which had so long
tormented him.</p>

<p>While experiencing the benevolence of Abensallah, he had naturally
thought with so much esteem of the Moorish character, that his
expedition appeared almost preposterous, and the destruction attendant
on it, doubly criminal; but now that he witnessed the real miseries of
slavery, and the detestableness of a tyrannical government, which
habituates every individual to the exercise of tyranny in his turn, zeal
once more assumed the rank of a virtue, and lulled conscience to
rest.&#8212;In addition to this, his own sufferings were softened by the
power he fortunately acquired of alleviating those of others.</p>

<p>Among the garden-labourers were two aged men, for whom he frequently
procured rest and refreshment, by fulfilling not only his own task, but
part of theirs: when he saw them fainting with thirst and exhaustion, he
would give them all that he had purposely saved from his scanty<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_234">{234}</a></span>
breakfast; their blessings were his luxuries, his only luxuries, but
such as warmed his heart far beyond all the enjoyments of his former
state.</p>

<p>Never till now had he known the full transport of doing good, for never
before had he done so at the expense of personal privations: sovereigns,
like gods, may scatter bounties with unsparing hands, yet never have
this sacred, soul-ennobling consciousness. Ought we then to envy, ah!
should we not rather pity that exalted station which demands from its
possessor so many cares, and rewards him with so few pleasures!</p>

<p>Though the governor of the gardens knew no other language than his own,
Sebastian managed to converse with him by signs, and to conciliate his
favour: from the instant in which he found himself capable of
benefitting the distressed, his servitude ceased to appear degrading,
and he toiled incessantly; his strength and his taste made him
inestimable; and by vo<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_235">{235}</a></span>luntary labour or ingenious plans of decoration,
he soon won so much on Hafiz, that he gained frequent intervals of rest
for his fellow slaves.</p>

<p>They were now employed in constructing and adorning a subterraneous
passage, in imitation of a natural grotto: there Sebastian amused
himself with a thousand tasteful fancies which enchanted the dull Hafiz,
and procured for him new proofs of kindness: from this success his
endeavours to please acquired fresh stimulus; he redoubled his efforts,
hoping to win so far upon the Moor, as at last to gain liberty through
this means.</p>

<p>After each day’s fatigue, the supper-hour was always welcome; it brought
him into the society of Gaspar. The conversation of his humble friend
was now Sebastian’s chief pleasure, for with him he felt himself
Sebastian still; sympathy of suffering, gratitude for affection, and
esteem of native goodness, united to heighten this pleasure: he talked
with Gaspar<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_236">{236}</a></span> of Portugal and liberty, of days past and days to come,
with all the ardour of unbroken youth.</p>

<p>Gaspar, in return, canvassed every possible mode of escape, continuing
to bewail the fate which separated him from his King: he was, however,
inspirited by some information lately obtained&#8212;it was as follows: at
certain periods the Moors permitted a few travelling friars, called
brothers of the redemption, to inspect their slaves, and to agree for
the ransom of such as they wished redeemed; one of these charitable men,
a native of Spain, was expected at Mequinez, by the next new moon; but
the Almoçadem having resolved never to sell any of his slaves, had
always refused to admit the friar, so that it would be necessary for
Sebastian to exert all his eloquence upon Hafiz, for him either to
petition the Almoçadem himself, or to let the friar know there was a
Portuguese nobleman under his care, who would reward him amply for
importuning El Hader in his favour.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_237">{237}</a></span></p>

<p>This information roused the sanguine nature of Sebastian; he believed
himself already on the threshold of liberty, and faithfully swore to
Gaspar that he would not accept of freedom without him for a companion.</p>

<p>Intoxicated with joy, and overflowing with devotedness, the young
Portuguese fell at his sovereign’s feet, pouring forth a broken torrent
of gratitude: Gaspar had been early taught to reverence and obey his
King, and now the amiable qualities of that King, being shewn to him
under the most affecting light, added to the principle of duty, every
sentiment of affection.</p>

<p>At this moment, while kissing the earth beneath Sebastian’s feet, he was
inwardly meditating a rash enterprize, full of danger, but fraught with
heroism: expecting little from Hafiz, Gaspar meant only to wait till one
attempt to gain him had been made and frustrated, and then he would
immediately execute his own project. His work lay in the open country,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_238">{238}</a></span>
where he was employed with other slaves in felling timber; there were
periods when the Moors who guarded them, were scattered about, and
therefore to be escaped, without instant notice: if Gaspar could get the
start of them by a single half-hour (being very swift of foot, and well
acquainted with a bye-road to Mequinez, where he had often gone with
loaded waggons) he might hope to reach the friar, and communicate the
secret of Don Sebastian’s existence.</p>

<p>Gaspar was certain that in pursuing him the Moors would first look among
the woods and hills leading to the interior, and that consequently,
though he was almost sure of falling eventually into their hands, his
object would be attained: the friar would convey the important news to
the christian forts, from thence it would be speedily transmitted to
Portugal and Spain, and then he doubted not, an army or a ransom, would
be sent to redeem their King.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_239">{239}</a></span></p>

<p>Some anxiety however, was still connected with his enterprize, even if
it should succeed: as Gaspar would hazard it without his royal master’s
knowledge, he could not bear any proof of his veracity, such as a ring
or piece of writing; he must rely solely on the sincerity of his manner,
and on that natural desire of crediting what we wish, which is implanted
in the human heart.</p>

<p>To disobey his sovereign on such an important point, he justly conceived
a duty due to his country; for Gaspar, though born in the sixteenth
century, had an intuitive conviction that his country’s claims were
superior even to the commands of her rulers.</p>

<p>Filled with this daring project, the young soldier arose from his
monarch’s feet with an illuminated countenance: a few moments after they
separated for their different chambers.</p>

<p>The only indulgence which Sebastian had asked for himself, was the
privilege of<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_240">{240}</a></span> passing his nights in a solitary apartment, this request
had been granted, with many assurances of its being an immense favour:
he now repaired to the place, which was a small room, scarcely large
enough to turn in, with a barred window and a straw bed. As he entered
it with an emotion of pleasure, the change of his destiny forcibly
struck him: what a cell for a King of Portugal, and the lover of Donna
Gonsalva to behold with gladness!</p>

<p>He went up to the narrow window, and as his eye fell on nothing but the
dark dwellings of the slaves, faintly lighted by the rays of a watry
moon, he looked from them to himself, and sighed profoundly. Not three
months back, he had worn the habit, and been surrounded by the glories
of a powerful prince; he had been ministered unto like a god, till the
most exquisite refinements of polished life had become natural wants; he
was now a slave, clad in coarse garments, denied the common necessaries
of his poorest subjects,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_241">{241}</a></span> forced to labour without intermission through
the day, and at night be immured in a wretched chamber, where solitude
was his only comfort!</p>

<p>For awhile, thought took so gloomy a cast, that he felt as if all that
sunny period of his life had been no more than a dream. The memory of
Stukeley appeared but the memory of some brilliant phantom; his rousing
eloquence, that had always acted on the soul of Sebastian like the sound
of the trumpet, was now passed away, his voice was hushed, his body gone
down to dust!</p>

<p>Nothing gives such apparent length to any portion of time, as a complete
change in outward scenes and inward feelings. Sebastian was scarcely
able to persuade himself that all these new emotions had been produced
by the events of so short a period as three months; he reviewed the
incidents which had happened since his landing in Africa, with a
bitterness of regret which was at length dispersed by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_242">{242}</a></span> idea of
Gaspar: in this faithful friend, providence was evidently preparing for
him a zealous assistant; at any rate, if his attachment might not aid,
it would assuredly console him, and was therefore to be gratefully
accepted as a sort of earnest of the divine succour.</p>

<p>Elevated by this thought, Sebastian’s feelings changed with their usual
rapidity, joy lightened his heart, and pouring out a fervent prayer over
the little cross of his order, (which he still preserved,) laid himself
to rest with the confidence of pious reliance.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_243">{243}</a></span></p>

<h2><a id="CHAP_VI"></a>CHAP. VI.</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">As</span> Gaspar was sure of learning from the good-natured Moor who had spoken
to him of the redemption friars, when father Mansonada would be at
Mequinez, he had cautioned the King not to put the absolute question to
Hafiz, before the friar’s arrival was actually announced, but to employ
the intermediate period in gaining his good will, urging the request at
the time when it must be either instantly refused or granted: this
precaution would leave no time for repentance.</p>

<p>Pursuant to this prudent resolution, the King continued to exert his
strength and his talents in every work given him by Hafiz: under his
hands the uncouth earthen passage grew into a romantic labyrinth,
diversified by spars and mosses,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_244">{244}</a></span> and hung with natural garlands of
flowering plants. Often while he was placing a stone or a shrub, he
smiled bitterly at what to him seemed womanish employment, and was
forced to remember that no occupation is disgraceful which is submitted
to for a great and virtuous purpose.</p>

<p>Having acquired many of the Morocco words, he was now able to hold short
conversations with Hafiz, who though grave, and somewhat dull, was not
insensible to merit; he liberally praised Sebastian, and for his sake
granted new indulgences to sickly slaves.</p>

<p>Sebastian marked his increasing influence with re-animated hope: having
his eye fixed but on one object, (freedom, in which every blessing is
included,) he disregarded all else, distributing among his fellow
captives such presents of dress and delicate food, as Hafiz occasionally
made him.</p>

<p>But the satisfaction arising from these<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_245">{245}</a></span> circumstances was considerably
diminished by an unforseen distress; Gaspar was taken ill: he had been
unusually fatigued lately, during an insufferably burning day; and at
night, had slept on some marshy ground with other Christians, who were
all attacked the following morning with illness:&#8212;The disorder seized
his lungs. From that hour a suffocating cough and slow fever preyed on
his strength. At all times delicate, he now lost his appetite and sleep;
and appeared hastening fast to that world “where the weary are at rest.”</p>

<p>Afflicted beyond measure, his royal friend no longer thought of exerting
any influence over Hafiz for his own peculiar gratification, but tried
to use it for Gaspar; he represented his situation in the most moving
terms, soliciting the Moor to get him transferred from the fields into
the gardens, where he promised to work in his place, allowing himself no
instant of recreation through the day, and but<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_246">{246}</a></span> four hours of rest at
night.&#8212;His importunities at length wrung from Hafiz a promise that he
would go and solicit the Almoçadem’s leave for the transfer.</p>

<p>Sebastian communicated this to Gaspar with all the ardour of pleasure,
the latter turned pale and faltered out an exclamation of regret;
painfully disappointed, Sebastian enquired the reason of this
disinclination to be near him, and soon found, from the generous
soldier, that it arose from concern at the sacrifices which he must make
on his account.</p>

<p>This indeed was part of the truth; but the most powerful cause was alarm
at a removal, which however agreeable to Gaspar, would put it out of his
power to serve his master: from the gardens he could not attempt escape
without involving him in his ruin should he be retaken, and therefore it
was necessary for him to wait no longer a return of health, but seize
this last opportunity of flying from the fields.&#8212;Perhaps another day
would<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_247">{247}</a></span> close the door of freedom for ever, as Hafiz, who had been sent
for to Mequinez by the Almoçadem, might return ere night: this thought
determined Gaspar.</p>

<p>Many and violent were his emotions when he parted from his beloved
master at the door of their cheerless lodging; the poor fellow felt
death at his heart, and scarcely knew how to hope for sufficient
strength to carry him to Mequinez, where, however, the arrival of friar
Mansonada was now happily ascertained. He fastened his eyes on the
countenance of Sebastian with the most sorrowful expression; the benign
smile that sat there, revived him for an instant, but fearful of
betraying any unusual agitation, he retired without speaking.</p>

<p>The next day Hafiz did not return, and at night Sebastian was surprized
by the non-appearance of Gaspar; concluding that he was cruelly kept out
at distant labour, he began to grow impatient for the sight of Hafiz:
still the governor re<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_248">{248}</a></span>turned not, and the next night and the one
following that Gaspar, too was absent.</p>

<p>Disturbed and alarmed, Sebastian approached a French Christian with whom
he had once seen Gaspar enter from work, and asked the man, in his own
language, what had become of him: the answer overwhelmed him with grief.</p>

<p>Gaspar had attempted to escape two days before, while the wood-slaves
were dispersed, and their guards carousing; he had got half way to
Mequinez when he was overtaken by two of the Moors, who having heard him
question another about the Friars Redemptione, guessed which way he was
going. After a short struggle, a wound in the leg brought Gaspar to the
ground, and rendered resistance impossible; he was now in the prison of
the Cassavee, where Ben Tarab threatened him with the extremity of the
bastinado that very night.</p>

<p>Sebastian too quickly comprehended<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_249">{249}</a></span> the motive of his friend’s rash
action; penetrated with gratitude and sorrow, he flew to the dark
building called the prison, intreating to be admitted, and offering
extravagant rewards to the Moors who guarded it:&#8212;Sebastian could not
always remember that he was no longer able to reward any one!&#8212;But these
vain promises were no sooner past his lips, than he disclaimed them,
with a stifled groan, and turned once more to intreaties.</p>

<p>The brutal Ben Tarab advanced cautiously, “You see I am armed;” was his
salutation, (pointing to a pair of huge pistols in his belt, and drawing
out a Moorish knife,) “in that case you dare not touch me: what is all
this tumult about?&#8212;is it because the dog is a Portuguese like
yourself?&#8212;or because you are colleagues? By the holy prophet! I believe
you deserve as sound a bastinadoing as he does. If he dies under the
thong, this night he shall receive a thousand<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_250">{250}</a></span> lashes. Get you to your
sleeping hole, and pretend not to thwart a Mussulman in his duty.”</p>

<p>Without replying, Sebastian shot an eagle glance round, as if in search
of something, the next instant he darted forwards, and snatching up a
hatchet which lay accidentally among some rubbish, flashed it in the
eyes of Ben Tarab.</p>

<p>“I too am armed!” he exclaimed fiercely, “approach but one step nearer
and this hatchet shall lay you dead at my feet.&#8212;I can die but once&#8212;yet
if I <i>do</i> fall, I will sell my life dearly.&#8212;Mark me! the man who takes
Gaspar to punishment from this prison must cut his way to him through my
heart.”</p>

<p>As he concluded, the stern frown of the young monarch withered Ben
Tarab’s courage, he drew back trembling, and tried to pull out one of
his pistols; Sebastian saw the action, and sprung on him like a tiger;
his powerful grasp pinioned the arms of the Moor, who believing him<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_251">{251}</a></span>self
in the very gripe of death, cried out for mercy: before any one could
come to his rescue, Sebastian flung him disdainfully away, saying&#8212;</p>

<p>“Take your worthless life&#8212;I want nothing beyond pity for a poor dying
man. Suffer me unmolested to keep watch before this prison till Hafiz
returns; then let the punishment of Gaspar be referred to the Almoçadem:
you will appear against him, I shall plead for him, I hope from the lips
of the humane Hafiz.”</p>

<p>Livid and trembling, Ben Tarab now sheltered himself behind a group of
Moors who had run in to his assistance: conscious that Sebastian was
indeed only to be conquered by death, and aware of the high value set on
him by El Hader, he feared to order the violence his base soul longed to
inflict.</p>

<p>“Stay then,” he cried at last, “Stay! and may plagues blister you for
your pains!&#8212;There you may watch and fast, for neither bed nor meal
shall you have<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_252">{252}</a></span> till Hafiz comes back and rids me of you altogether.
Soldiers, take care he is not too subtle for you; look to him well.”&#8212;So
saying, Ben Tarab left the court, shutting its huge stone gates after
him, with a rage that threatened to crash them.</p>

<p>Sebastian grasped his hatchet and sat quietly down upon the steps of the
prison, while two Moorish guards walked backwards and forwards,
discoursing about this mad Christian, who would certainly be condemned
to the rack by their illustrious master.</p>

<p>In this situation, full of agitating thoughts, the King of Portugal past
the night: fortunately for him, Hafiz returned the next day, and having
missed Sebastian in the gardens, came to inquire for him of Ben Tarab;
that brutal fellow related the events of the last few days with all the
exaggerations of inveterate animosity, sending Hafiz to threaten his
favorite slave with a chain or a log.</p>

<p>Sebastian’s character was one of ex<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_253">{253}</a></span>tremes; he was alternately the
fiercest and the gentlest of mankind; where he saw the trace of humanity
he could quell every movement of passion, and enter into the calmest and
most considerate explanations: he now let the wrath of Hafiz take its
course, waiting till it was spent, before he expatiated upon the natural
love we bear our countrymen; and the impossibility of refraining from
some shew of violence when any object whom we sincerely love is
threatened with danger. The poor dying youth being menaced with the
bastinado, was, on this reasoning, a sufficient plea for his own
vehemence.</p>

<p>Sebastian mingled these with strong appeals to that sentiment of Liberty
which he presumed dwelt in the bosom of Hafiz, in common with every
honest man, he besought his pity;&#8212;and finished by declaring, that if
Gaspar perished, neither whips nor daggers should ever compel <i>him</i> to
any act of labour.</p>

<p>All these arguments had their weight,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_254">{254}</a></span> but especially the last; Hafiz
feared to lose the very flower of his workmen, and therefore promised to
go immediately to Kara Aziek, the daughter of El Hader, and try to
obtain Gaspar’s pardon from her: this favorite and only surviving child
of the Almoçadem had come that morning from Mequinez, merely to see the
subterraneous labyrinth, and having been enchanted with its novelty and
beauty, Hafiz hoped might be induced to pronounce the desired
forgiveness. Hastening away, he returned in a short time with the
Moorish Lady’s order for the release and removal of Gaspar.</p>

<p>Penetrated with gratitude proportionate to his late apprehension,
Sebastian vehemently thanked the good Moor, and went with him into the
prison.</p>

<p>As they approached the dungeon in which Gaspar was, his feeble groans
alone broke the sullen silence; he was the only human being who had
slept in that dismal place during three nights, and might have<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_255">{255}</a></span> perished
there, without even the hope of succour: at the sound of his royal
master’s voice, he slowly raised his head, and supported himself for an
instant; but he sunk again, overpowered with pain and
weakness.&#8212;Sebastian hastened to catch him on his breast, while Hafiz
assured him he was pardoned, and going to be removed entirely from the
influence of Ben Tarab.</p>

<p>The prejudiced yet well-meaning Moor accompanied this information with
several animadversions upon the folly and ingratitude of attempting an
escape from a residence where all the slaves were treated like trusty
servants; bidding him remember, that as it was solely for Fabian’s sake
he was forgiven, a second fault would draw Fabian into the same
destruction.</p>

<p>Gaspar could only reply by a submissive motion of the head, for a
merciless neglect of sending him food had rendered him so weak he could
scarcely speak; he was besides too joyful for utterance; but he held his
sovereign’s hand alternately<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_256">{256}</a></span> to his lips and to his heart, with an
energy of gratitude that needed no additional eloquence.</p>

<p>The wound in Gaspar’s leg was more painful that it appeared dangerous,
so that Sebastian trusted he might yet recover both from it and his
pulmonary complaint, if properly nursed, and kept for awhile from
labouring amongst evening and morning mists:&#8212;he now made an earnest
petition to Hafiz for permission to inhabit some chamber adjoining that
allotted to Gaspar, in order that he might be thus enabled to devote
every leisure moment to his suffering friend.</p>

<p>After long resisting, Hafiz reluctantly yielded; first stipulating some
new exercise of his favorite’s ingenuity, by way of equivalent:&#8212;Gaspar
was then conveyed to another quarter of the Cassavee, where the
household slaves are lodged, and a small but not wretched apartment was
assigned to him.</p>

<p>His wound was examined, and his in<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_257">{257}</a></span>ternal disorder prescribed for, by a
skilful renegado who acted as family physician and surgeon; Sebastian
would fain have staid to assist this man, but Gaspar himself could not
bear the thought of so employing his King, and Hafiz now waited for him
at the labyrinth.</p>

<p>Eager to repay the worthy Moor’s kindness by increased diligence,
Sebastian hurried into the gardens; all his generous and delighted heart
beamed on his noble countenance as he moved through the verdant groves
and lawns leading to the grotto; as he was hastily advancing, he was
checked by an unusual sight: a group of Moorish women were just issuing
from the entrance.</p>

<p>Rightly conjecturing that these were the Almoçadem’s daughter and her
attendants, he drew back: one of the ladies was richly habited after the
Morocco fashion, in a kaftan and turban embroidered with coloured silks
and precious stones; her mildly superior air declared her to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_258">{258}</a></span> Kara
Aziek: she drew her veil closer at sight of a man, but stopping at the
same time, said a few words to Hafiz in a very soft voice. Sebastian
ventured to advance; he bent one knee to the ground, making a sign
expressive of gratitude; Kara Aziek courteously motioned him to rise,
and then moved away: but she frequently looked back as she went, and on
turning into another walk, graciously noticed him still, by a gentle
inclination of her head.</p>

<p>Sebastian’s eyes remained fixed on the vacant space which her figure had
occupied: it was the first time he had seen a woman since he had entered
Africa, (for he would not give that title to the female Alarbes) and for
the first time, a train of sweet and tender emotions, glided through his
bosom.</p>

<p>The appearance of a young and pleasing woman, is ever associated in the
mind of man when under affliction, with hope of consolation and
expectation of relief<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_259">{259}</a></span>&#8212;Kara Aziek’s dove-like voice and pitying manner,
would of themselves have been sufficient to rouse up the sanguine spirit
of Sebastian, but when to these were added the late proofs of her
humanity or yieldingness, he could not help indulging in reveries as
delightful as they were unexpected: in five minutes his ardent
imagination had gone through a whole romance of disinterested generosity
on her part, and boundless gratitude on his; she had facilitated his
escape, restored him to his people, and become the friend of his soul’s
treasure, the incomparable Donna Gonsalva.</p>

<p>Transported with these fantastic day-dreams, he scarcely heard the
precise Hafiz, who was all this while endeavouring to explain to him,
Kara Aziek’s commands about the gardens: starting at her name, he begged
to have those commands repeated.</p>

<p>Hafiz deliberately recapitulated them; adding, that their young
mistress, who<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_260">{260}</a></span> was going immediately back to Mequinez, wished her new
orders to be fulfilled before the feast of Ramadan, on which she should
return with her father; that on hearing the particulars of Gaspar’s
situation, she had instructed Hafiz, to have him carefully attended, and
supplied with proper nourishment; avowing her intention of reporting Ben
Tarab’s barbarity to the Almoçadem, who though strict with his slaves,
was averse to their being cruelly treated.</p>

<p>When Hafiz ended, Sebastian abruptly exclaimed&#8212;“Perhaps I should bless
my captivity, since it daily frees me from prejudice!&#8212;Hafiz, when I
first fought against your countrymen, I believed myself combatting a set
of wretches, devoid of every human feeling: since then, I have learned
to think that the Maker of Heaven and earth, breathes so much of his
divine spirit through some rare souls, that not even the pollutions of a
false religion, can wholly deface their original beauty!&#8212;I<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_261">{261}</a></span> had been
told that your women were little better than agreeable images, without
thought or will: how is it that this young and admirable lady, has been
thus moved to compassionate a Christian, and condemn a Mahometan?”</p>

<p>“O, I can soon satisfy you;” answered the simple-minded Hafiz, “I begged
for this Gaspar, in the name of Sidie Absalom.”</p>

<p>“And who is Sidie Absalom?” asked Sebastian.</p>

<p>“You would not ask that,” returned his companion, “if you had ever read
the Holy Book of the Jews; he was a beautiful young man, the son of one
King David&#8212;‘<i>From the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head,
there was no blemish in him.</i>’&#8212;our women pray to him as to a saint; ask
them any thing in his name, and they are afraid to deny you, for fear of
not getting a husband as handsome as he was.”</p>

<p>Sebastian smiled at his simplicity; Kara<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_262">{262}</a></span> Aziek’s actions seemed worthy
of a better motive, and he failed not to bestow on them one infinitely
nobler.</p>

<p>Hafiz now hurried him to labour: the good Moor, proud of distinction,
and aware that to the activity and taste of his Portuguese slave, he
should owe some liberal mark of the Almoçadem’s satisfaction, exhorted
Sebastian to employ all his invention in new adornments for the baths
and fountains, and in bringing to perfection the nursery of fragrant
exotics, which Kara Aziek had requested he might attend.</p>

<p>Sebastian needed not an additional incitement to these humble tasks: it
was motive enough for him, that by fancying light decorations, requiring
more ingenuity than strength to accomplish, he spared his
fellow-captives many a weary labour: Hafiz had long trusted them almost
solely to his direction, well satisfied with seeing beautiful novelties
rising around him, though he knew that they<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_263">{263}</a></span> did not occupy half the
time, nor exhaust half the bodily powers he had formerly been forced to
lavish.</p>

<p>The slaves blessed with longer intervals of rest, were no more pale and
squalid; they had leisure for decent attention to their persons, and
permitted to form for themselves many minor comforts, health and
resignation (for content can never dwell with slavery) began to appear
in their looks: at this sight Sebastian’s heart glowed within him, and
the consciousness of being the source from whence these blessings
flowed, increased the glow. On retiring for the night of this eventful
day, Hafiz allowed the King to gather some choice fruits for Gaspar,
with which he hastened from the gardens.</p>

<p>Gaspar was already supplied with a basket of the finest grapes, and a
flask of medicated asses milk, (balm of Mecca being infused in it) by a
servant of Kara<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_264">{264}</a></span> Aziek’s: he had temperately partaken of these presents,
and was even then revived by them.</p>

<p>The details which now took place between the King and his humble friend,
were not unmixed with pleasure; Gaspar could not conceal the
affectionate motive of his mad enterprize, nor could his royal master
refrain from shewing the extent of his gratitude, by describing the
scene which had passed between him and Ben Tarab&#8212;new plans for their
mutual liberation were then canvassed, and these might all be summed up
in a determination of seeking the favour of Kara Aziek, through whose
interference perhaps they might prevail on the Almoçadem to permit some
communication between them and the Christian forts.</p>

<p>At this prospect, Gaspar could not check a sigh purely selfish: his
cruel disorder forbade him to indulge the fond hope of ever again
beholding Portugal:<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_265">{265}</a></span> this painful emotion burst forth, followed by a
reflection far more grievous to Sebastian than it was to himself.</p>

<p>“I must submit,” he said, “if it pleases Heaven to deny me the joy of
witnessing my sovereign’s restoration to his people: doubtless I sinned
in deserting my poor mother and sisters for the mere sake of fighting
against infidels; my wrong notions of duty perhaps, have left these dear
relations to starve, for I was their only protector.&#8212;Jesu help me! I
did not think then, what I have often thought since, that our blessed
Redeemer must be better pleased with us when we seek to preserve lives,
than when we go to destroy them!”</p>

<p>This artless remark made the King change colour: if Gaspar believed that
to die in miserable servitude was only a just punishment for moral
ignorance, what must be <i>his</i> destiny by whose powerful example
multitudes had been allured into<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_266">{266}</a></span> a similar error?&#8212;Sebastian’s heart
was disturbed; and he paused at this question. Though he did not answer
it to himself at that moment, he often repeated it afterwards; and the
subject connected with it, was then attentively examined. His days of
prosperity had been unreflecting days,&#8212;adversity now taught him to
scrutinize the past, and to prepare stores of principle for the future:
formerly, he had only <i>acted of himself; now he began to think for
himself</i>.</p>

<p>Without suffering Gaspar to perceive the pain his remark had caused,
Sebastian soothed the poor fellow’s self-accusing feelings, joined in an
act of devotion with him, and did not leave him till he saw that he was
tranquillized in sleep: he then repaired to a neighbouring chamber,
where he spent nearly all the remaining hours of night in earnest
supplications for an enlightened spirit.</p>

<p>From this period the attention of Sebas<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_267">{267}</a></span>tian was divided between so many
objects of anxiety that he had not leisure for regret: though he was
often wrung by the thought of Gonsalva’s too-probable grief, and
apprehension for the fates of Antonio and De Castro, present cares
forbade him to dwell on such considerations; he thought yet oftener of
escape, and while so much was left him to hope, did not feel privileged
to lament.</p>

<p>Each day now saw him incessantly occupied, each evening restored him to
Gaspar; that poor youth’s slow-consuming disorder had not yet given way
to the Moorish prescriptions,&#8212;unable to stand long upon his wounded
limb, Gaspar could not be employed in field-work, but his grateful
disposition taught him a new species of usefulness, and he amused his
solitary hours by the manufacture of ingenious trifles, such as
ornamental baskets, brocaded sandals, &amp;c. with which Hafiz was to
present Kara Aziek on her return to the cassavee.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_268">{268}</a></span></p>

<p>Sebastian had found leisure intervals for the accomplishment of a
trifling object with which he frequently lulled the depressed spirits of
his friend; it was a flute formed of cane; he had contrived to furnish
it with stops, &amp;c. and had at length made it capable of “discoursing
most excellent music.”</p>

<p>In the tranquillity of evening, when Gaspar was laid on his narrow
pallet, and their minds equally exhausted by agitating conversation,
Sebastian would take his flute and play Portuguese airs, till Africa was
forgotten, and their native country alone remembered.&#8212;It was in these
moments that love reigned absolute over the heart of the young King; he
could not breathe a note that did not recal some song of Donna
Gonsalva’s; her celestial voice seemed floating around him, till
tenderness melted him into weakness, or impatience lashed him into
agony, and the instrument would then fall from his hand.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_269">{269}</a></span></p>

<p>Experience alone teaches us the mutability of fortune: we hear of it, we
see it, we think we understand and believe it,&#8212;but when we find
<i>ourselves</i> precipitated from an height of happiness into an abyss of
misery, it is then for the first time that we really discover the
slightness of our former perceptions.&#8212;The adversity of others “we write
in sand;” our own “we engrave on brass.”</p>

<p>Sebastian had now constant opportunities of making this reflection, for
until his dismal change, absolute power had prevented him from even
dreaming of a reverse in his own person: since that reverse had
happened, he bitterly lamented his precipitate promise to the pope,
whose sanction might otherwise have been obtained, and then Gonsalva
would have been left at least a queen, protected by wealth and
authority.</p>

<p>But these regrets could not recal the past; they were useful only as
lessons for<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_270">{270}</a></span> the future:&#8212;he averted his mind from such reflections,
directing all its energies, towards the present objects of his care.</p>

<p>Some of these were attained: his fellow-slaves of the garden were
comparatively happy through his means; Hafiz continued to shew him
increasing regard; and Gaspar was losing most of those alarming symptoms
which so lately threatened his life.&#8212;Though in slavery, and condemned
to perpetual labour, the young monarch had never yet smarted under one
degrading indignity which he would hereafter blush to have survived:
this was a consolation almost transporting; it assured him of divine
protection, he thought, seeming to say, that Providence might bend but
would not crush him.</p>

<p>As it was from Kara Aziek that Sebastian anticipated the completion of
every hope, he was naturally inquisitive about her character and habits
of life: by<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_271">{271}</a></span> his facility of acquiring languages (the most enviable
because the most useful of talents,) he was now competent to converse
with Hafiz in excellent Moresco; he therefore seized an opportunity one
day when they were alone together inspecting her nursery of exotics, and
questioned him respecting their gentle mistress.</p>

<p>He learnt in reply that Kara Aziek was the sole surviving child of the
Almoçadem by a Portuguese lady who had been carried off by a set of
those pirates, who frequently plundered the neighbouring coasts, and
brought to Morocco: as she was scarcely passed childhood, El Hader had
succeeded in persuading her to change her religion, and to become his
wife, upon the condition that he never would marry any others; this
promise he had kept, living in harmony with her many years, until they
were separated by death.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_272">{272}</a></span></p>

<p>Though this lady was not a woman of much sense, she was accomplished,
and constitutionally humane; her influence had softened the prejudices
of the Almoçadem, so that he suffered her to educate her daughter after
the European fashion, in all respects, save religion: Kara Aziek was
therefore mistress of the Portuguese and Italian languages, and the
literature of both countries; she was a Mahometan it is true; but her
expanded and inquiring mind, her pure, beneficent spirit, etherialized
the grossness of her creed, and made her almost a Christian, <i>in
action</i>.</p>

<p>After her mother’s death, Aziek became sole arbiter of her father’s
decrees; at her request he granted such indulgencies to his slaves as no
other slaves throughout Barbary ever enjoyed, but unhappily these
indulgencies had never been faithfully administered:&#8212;Kara Aziek was too
young and inexperienced to conceive the possibility of her father’s
benevolent com<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_273">{273}</a></span>mands being disobeyed, or rather not obeyed with
eagerness; she therefore believed the Christians to be well fed,
moderately worked, humanely treated; when in reality most of their
task-masters appropriated the liberal allowances to themselves; sold
their surplus of labour; and in fact tyranized over both their bodies
and their souls.</p>

<p>The freedom of a captive she had never obtained. El Hader thought it
argued well for his piety that neither money nor persuasions could
induce him to liberate an enemy of his prophet; on this point he was
inflexible; and Sebastian, on hearing it, scarcely knew how to hope any
thing for himself:&#8212;but hope is a sturdy plant that will grow on the
most rocky soil; it is destined for the aliment of man’s spiritual part,
and without it he could not exist.</p>

<p>Encouraged by the gentleness of Aziek’s character, Sebastian believed
that she might<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_274">{274}</a></span> be easily induced to pity, and finally to assist
him&#8212;perhaps her intreaties might not always be unsuccessful:&#8212;Fraught
with these ideas he heard of her return with the Almoçadem.</p>

<p>The day after their arrival he was sent for by El Hader:&#8212;“Young man!”
said he in Moorish, “come hither, I want to ask you if you are now
willing to accept the distinguished post I had destined for you, that of
attending on my person wherever I go, even into the presence of the
illustrious Xeriff himself? I hear you have been a perfect whirlwind
amongst my people, and that you will do nothing but what you please; is
this true?”</p>

<p>“I have not been used to obey:” replied Sebastian, proudly, “but I
believe my incessant labours will shew that I am not ungrateful for
kindness. These limbs are young and strong, and capable of much fatigue;
but some of my unfortunate companions are sick, and old, and oppressed,
and for them I have struggled.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_275">{275}</a></span>”</p>

<p>“Aye, so it seems;” answered El Hader, with a gracious nod, “my daughter
tells me that your rash attack upon my servant, Ben Tarab, was to be
applauded; to that I do not assent, for you should respect the servants
of the great El Hader as his delegates: however, we will pass that over,
in consideration of your youth and folly, and natural wish to defend a
countryman.&#8212;I have pardoned both you, and that still more rebellious
slave Gaspar, at my daughter’s intreaty: see that you behave better in
future; if either of you attempt a second escape, or brave a domestic of
mine a second time, not even the tears of my well-beloved Kara Aziek
shall save you from destruction.&#8212;But tell me, are you inclined to
accept the high distinction of waiting on my person?”</p>

<p>The proud and fiery King of Portugal started at this question; he
surveyed the infidel from head to foot with a look of insufferable
disdain, and then burst into a<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_276">{276}</a></span> scornful laugh:&#8212;his laugh had something
terrible in it, independent of the consuming fire of his eyes; El Hader
nimbly started up from the cushions on which he was lolling, and
retreated through an adjacent door:&#8212;Sebastian did not wait for his
re-appearance, but immediately withdrew.</p>

<p>The degrading mark of favor offered by one whom he esteemed only a few
degrees above some harmless brute animal, had stung the feelings of
Sebastian almost to madness; he traversed the gardens with a swelling
heart, but a glimpse of Kara Aziek changed the indignant throb into a
thrill of pleasure:&#8212;he saw her at a little distance walking with some
other Moorish ladies. Crossing his hands over his breast, he stopt and
bowed his head; she recognized him through her veil, and graciously
returned the salutation; her visitors half uncovered their faces to look
at the Christian about whom they had been<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_277">{277}</a></span> conversing, but Aziek moved
away, and Sebastian dared not remain.</p>

<p>After that day he constantly beheld her in the gardens; sometimes only
at a distance, reading or playing on her guitar. No opportunity had yet
occurred of addressing her in private; for when she went with him over
the quarter assigned to the culture of Portuguese shrubs, to learn their
names and qualities, she was surrounded by her maids, and he was
followed by Hafiz. But obstacles only stimulated the king’s impatience;
other circumstances tended to counteract them. For some time he had
every night found in his chamber the most exquisite confections, bread,
and sherbet: (presents, evidently the product of female hands,) he
shared them with Gaspar, not doubting the benevolent giver was she who
had already been so generous.</p>

<p>The only return he could make, was daily offerings of flowers formed
into<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_278">{278}</a></span> garlands or arranged in bouquets, for the head and bosom of Kara
Aziek; these were presented to her by Hafiz, who reluctantly
acknowledged that they came from his slave Fabian: Aziek would smile,
accept them, inhale their scent awhile, admire their arrangement, and
then place them among her beautiful hair instead of more costly
ornaments.</p>

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue

        works.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
